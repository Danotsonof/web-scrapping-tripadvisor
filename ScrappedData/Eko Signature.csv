Nice overnight stay,"I stayed here for one night. The hotel is next to the main Eko hotel and a newer version. The ambiance is nice and hotel is located in Victoria Island of Lagos.  It is a popular hotel and also very busy.   Check in and check out was a breeze. Breakfast was ok, many options. My room was big but there wasn’t any hot water.",October 2023,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Oct 2023,"New York, New York, United States","['320 contributions', '59 helpful votes']",40,[]
Strategic location,A two-day stay: Major highlight is the strategic location of the hotel. You can explore Lagos adequately from its location. A major letdown is limited variety of breakfast buffet. Also a bit crowdy when dignitaries like traditional rulers are guests.,September 2021,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Sep 2021,"Abuja, Nigeria",['5 contributions'],40,[]
Wasted potential but with  flashes of greatness,"We visited Eko Signature  for our holiday in March 2020. Our first visit was in 2017 and we were let down by some elements but the then Manager was outstanding in his response - so we tried again. Unfortunately, the Manager had left.   The  positive things about the hotel are the layout very spacious and clean. The decor is bright and modern. The two points are for the interior designer and architectural team.   The negatives are many. The staff are almost without exception cold and unhelpful. Exceptions are Emeka, and I think another senior male, average height dark with glasses (whose name alludes me). These two members of staff were exceptionally polite, helpful and courteous. Some of the concierge are also delightful and helpful.

Good overall,"Eko is likely the best complex to stay at, we did almost 2 weeks and didn't really get bored of the restaurant choice etc - nice secure complex  The Signature is the top hotel in the complex and is good enough with some faults  - check in good - weekends involve lots of partying and noise until all hours, guy next to me was having a ball - breakfast good enough - wifi, daily codes really needs fixed, very annoying and not great  - beds good - laundry a bit unreliable - feels safe all round  Rob",May 2018,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2018,"Canmore, Canada","['1325 contributions', '391 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40']"

Beware 'breakfast included',"If you are travelling as a family (I.e 2 or more adults,1or more kids') breakfast is only for one person if you book as a group in one room. The rest of the group pay 7500 niara per day for breakfast.  This hotel does not give you the option on their website and not any of their partnering websites (eg booking.com expedia etc) to pay one inclusive price for breakfast for more than one guest for the duration of your stay . So prepare yourself with facing added expenses to your holiday when you get there.

A stunning 5 star property with flaws,"The rooms in the Signature are over the top. They are huge with really good beds, a sofa with coffee table and chairs as well as a meeting table for 4 and desk space. The bathroom is also well appointed. The hotel gym is one of the best I have ever been into with plenty of equipment all in good condition. the property has numerous restaurants so you wont get bored on an extended stay. The staff are friendly and very attentive and I must give mention to Vincent in the bar as well as the general manager from Jordan whose name I cannot recall. The flaws. 1) the rain shower in the bathroom was great but couldn't be used as it flooded not only the bathroom but out into the bedroom. 2) Several Dstv channels don't work.

Stay at Eko Signature,"My wife & I stayed a night at the Eko Signature.   Commendably, the hotel room is big & spacious, neatly arranged with a sitting area and a reading table. The decor was quite nice and simple.  The bathroom is also spacious and of a very decent size although there was no body lotion, just the soap and shampoo. I also noticed that the bathroom floor was stained, which could have been taken care of.  The major negative for me was the staff attitude. The attitude of the hotel staff in the breakfast room was very poor, rude & unfriendly. They passed snide remarks at guests that don’t understand the local language. I witnessed this first hand while I was there.  The room floor staff were very polite and warm during our visit.",November 2017,,,wrote a review Nov 2017,"Ontario, Canada","['72 contributions', '70 helpful votes']",30,[]

Birthday Dinner,We celebrated my daughter's 21st birthday at the 1415 Restaurant at Eko Signature - there were just about 18 of us but we had a splendid time. The ambience was delightful and the food was good. The staff were very attentive to our needs and bent over backwards to meet the little quirks of some guests. The staff even  made sure that other guests to the restaurant were seated in a different area which made the event all the more special for us. We had a great time...but we forgot to ask the price of the wine before the bottles were opened!!,August 2017,,,wrote a review Sep 2017,"Greater London, United Kingdom",['2 contributions'],40,[]
Not a Bad choice if staying in Lagos,"I have stayed in many hotels in Lagos over the years - The Wheatbaker, Intercontinental, Federal Palace, Southern Sun - you get the picture - I could go on but I'll stop here.  Eko Signature has now become my hotel of choice.   I'll start with the things I like about the about the signature hotel. I love the fact that if you don't want to go out you have a variety of restaurants on the grounds to chose from without having to go out.  The rooms are finished to high standard (compared to some of the other hotels in Lagos). They are spacious, Nespresso machines with pods replaced daily, bathroom ok - again very large. The room is very colourful. Effective air conditioning. Great gym, nice pool. The bed  was very large and very comfortable.

The number 1 choice for Lagos!,"Definitely the first choice if you want a Western-style luxury hotel in Lagos. The price is quite steep, but the quality of the rooms reflects this. The hotel is situated within a secure, guarded compound, along with other Eko hotels, but with its own entrance.  All of the rooms are suites, very large and nicely appointed with decent internet and nice bathrooms. All sheets and towels changed every day, which to me is a bit too good in a country short of water like Nigeria. I'd have been happy not to have my bedding and towels changed daily.  Staff are all very pleasant and eager to please. Also honest... I left my safe open rushing out one morning with passport and over $500 in cash, plus my iPad, and it was not touched.  Only reason I have put 4 stars and not 5 is that there",July 2017,,,wrote a review Jul 2017,"Chester, United Kingdom","['66 contributions', '42 helpful votes']",40,[]
Good hotel on Victoria Island,I was upgraded to this hotel after they had overbooked at the Eko hotel next door.  The room was spacious clean and had good air conditioning and working wifi. The breakfast buffet was good and had a lot of local and international options. I looked for the gym but couldn't find it so gave up looking.  The hotel is in a complex with several other hotels from the same brand but the signature is by far the best. The grounds are not structured and there is not a green space and very little interest in being outside.  The expérience was not great at checkin as arrived around 9 PM and they told me the rooms were not ready and they asked me to wait in the reception area and gave me the wifi password.

Could have been better if not for shower,"Huge and comfortable room. Everything looked nice and shiny. Would have earned a better rating from me if not for the terrible experience in the shower. The air con was set to a freezing 19deg Celsius and I made the mistake of committing to the shower  thinking that it'll be straightforward.  There were 2 showers, one outside the bathtub and one inside.  The hot water took forever to come on so I had to wait very long. When it came, the floor trap started flooding and could flood into the rest of the bathroom. So I moved into the bathtub and tried to work the shower there.  No luck for hot water after a few minutes and I was shivering like in a winter country. Ended up using the outside shower inside the bathtub, thankfully the hose was long enough else had to choose between",April 2017,,,wrote a review Apr 2017,"Singapore, Singapore","['173 contributions', '62 helpful votes']",20,[]

"The Good, The Bad, The Hilarious","The Good o Clean, sophisticated-ly decorated hallways and rooms that were huge…HUGE! o One of the most comfortable hotel bedding I have ever experienced, dangerously so o Polite, accommodating staff o The breakfast: good, variety o Shout out to an excellent hotel manager, Gio, who was so involved, hardworking and paid attention to every detail  The Bad o The ac/heater came with instructions that weren’t clear and involved quite a bit of fiddling to regulate o The shower on the other hand should have come with instructions as it had a tad too many knobs o The shower could be hotter on a more consistent basis   The Hilarious o I found 20 GBP in my room late in the evening; confused, I attempted to call the front desk to “report” and return it should the previous owner call to",December 2016,,,wrote a review Jan 2017,,"['8 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",50,[]
One of the top 5 Hotels in Lagos,"Eko Signature is definitely one the top 5 hotels in Lagos. It is the newest part of The Eko Hotel group.   Most of the rooms are Junior suites with a king Bed, a long leather 4 seater settee, a coffee table and round glass 4 seater dinning table, two desktop telephone, and an HD Flat screen television.   The rooms are beautifully colour coded so that every room you enter is different. Your sheets are totally changed everyday, 2 bathrobes, 2 slippers, several towels in the bathroom, supplied will all amenities you might need.   If you are checking in with family like I do, you can insist on connecting rooms at the point of reservation so it's noted. The hotel is usually fully nearly booked due the quality and the proximity to the large state of the art event Centre right next to",December 2016,,,wrote a review Dec 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['455 contributions', '132 helpful votes']",50,[]
It was very good.,Once you leave outside you won't believe you are still in the same country.   The room was very clean and their high standard of no smoking was very good. We came in and got upgraded because the management were not happy with the level of cleaning in our supposed room. And then we were sent non alcoholic drinks because we don't take alcohol and we got lots of water in the room on arrival and breakfast was also good.  The staff greeted you whether you enter them to or not.   The roof top restaurant was also very good even though they took a while cooking the food but it came eventually.    We stayed in the signature suite but can't wait to come back and stay in the presidentail suite.   Nice one guys keep up the good work but please serve drinks made and sold in Nigeria.

Nice property missing on basics,"Very well maintained property, good service and large rooms. Constant login for wifi is frustrating ... frustrating to such an extent that I don't intend to come back here just for this one reason. The iron box delivered to the rooms are not cleaned prior & towels provided in the room are beige colored - which indicates the managements desire to pass unclean towels. There is a reason why most hotels provide white towels - it puts the guest at ease that the towels are clean",November 2016,,,wrote a review Nov 2016,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['186 contributions', '49 helpful votes']",30,[]
