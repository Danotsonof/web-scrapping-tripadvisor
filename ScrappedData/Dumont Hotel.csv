Poor Customer Service,"It was a brief stay for 2 nights. The hotel was booked through a travel site and payment was agreed to be on arrival. On arrival at check-in, I was immediately told their POS machines - about 5- were not working and I had to go and obtain cash to pay for the accommodation. The receptionist could not be concerned. It was already dark and I had to speak to a Manager to allow check-in while this could be resolved later. The bed in my room was very noisy and seemed to have problems with the spring. Their food was unreasonably too expensive that I had to drive out to look for food. The next day, the key was dropped at reception for the room to be cleaned by 3 pm. Upon return, this had not been done. I was later informed that the person in charge had closed. When I asked for breakfast",November 2017,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Nov 2017,"Lagos, Nigeria","['141 contributions', '83 helpful votes']",20,"['Location bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_20']"
Good Experience,"A good resting place for family outing or business. Warm reception, good lift, good parking space, good air conditioning, comfortable beds but rooms are a bit squeezy with too many mirrors - maybe to create an illusion of more space. The multi-purpose hall also opens into the reception, which I consider poor design. They cook well for a typical Lagos hotel. I will certainly call again. I score them 7 over 10.",January 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2017,"Abuja, Nigeria","['27 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30']"
