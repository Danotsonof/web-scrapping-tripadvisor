A quiet place within Victoria Island,"Fryburgh is a small hotel, it looks like a residential house converted to a hotel. It is a small place with little or few amenities. The room is not that big but moderate, the furnitures are old but maintained. The hotel is situated in a serene environment within Victoria Island. The staff are very courteous, thanks to Roseline, the receptionist who helped to book a taxi for using her handset.",August 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2023,Abuja,"['42 contributions', '35 helpful votes']",30,[]
