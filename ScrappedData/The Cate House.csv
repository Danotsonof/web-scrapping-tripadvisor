Just okay,"Overall, the place was decent although it's disappointing when staff are not a good reflection representing the business, they work for the ladies at the front desk wasn't friendly. We tried to look pass it but this in fact would move us to look for another place to stay even if it's cost more than to be treated as if we don't belong. The room was spacious enough for us, but the linen was white and dingy.",April 2021,,,wrote a review Mar 2022,"Ashburn, Virginia","['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",20,"['Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_20', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Cool Boutique Hotel,"Quiet, serene and neat are the right words to describe this hotel, it’s also in a quiet environment, if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Lagos this is the place for you. A wide variety of meals that are mostly available but the kitchen closes by 10pm. The staffs are polite and friendly as well.",December 2021,Traveled as a couple,There is no parking space,wrote a review Jan 2022,"Asaba, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],40,[]
Cate house,"I was with my bf at cate house for like 4 days or so. Everything is neat n clean. Friendly communities. The gym is only for one person, everytime me n my bf wanted to go work out, it was a problem. The gym staffs were very friendly, nice n helpful. Breakfast is only for one person. I tried eating one plate with my bf n it was a problem. I broke my makeup in the bathroom n used the hotel towel to cleaned it n the hotel manager a lady.. Came to me n said I shoukdnt so it again..that next time I would've to pay for the towel...I was shocked bec where I came from towel is nothing although she wasnt rude about it but I still felt bad. Will I ever go back to this hotel again....hmmmm maybe, it wasnt that bad. They need to fix the gym situation",August 2019,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Jul 2020,"Fargo, North Dakota","['2 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]
