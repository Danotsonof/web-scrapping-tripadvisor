JARA BEACH RESORT -THE HIDDEN GEM IN LAGOS STATE NIGERIA,"My family and I had an amazing time at Jara Beach Resort, the first of its kind, and unarguably the only all-inclusive, oceanfront getaway in Lagos. The resort is located in Museyo, next to Eleko, in the Lekki axis OF Lagos State Nigeria. It‚Äôs the perfect place to escape from the stress of Lagos and enjoy some quality time with nature and yourself. The resort is family-run, and they treat you like one of their own.  .   The resort is cozy and beautiful, with 13 rooms that have everything you need for a comfortable stay. We stayed in the villa at the resort, but I must tell you that all the other rooms are just as amazing as the villa, and you get the same top-notch service all around the resort. The bed was so soft, and the pillows were fluffy.

Worst experience of my whole life!,"So during our stay they burnt down the entire top building of their staff rooms - then all the locals flooded the place for hours and were staring and mocking my ‚Äòforeign‚Äô looking children. The firemen swam & spat in the pool. They made us sleep in the dark until my husband kicked up a fuss to the girl staff who was leaning over and into him! Then weeks later they ‚Äòfound‚Äô the money to acquire the entire land next door, developed it and doubled their business!

"Wonderful stay, nice food, refreshing ambience and exceptional great staff","I had a short stay there with my close family. The staff are honestly the best thing about Jara Beach resort. They are the best out of any hotel/destination in Nigeria that I have visited so far. They were extremely polite, kind, eager to help and very fast with orders and requests.  The food was amazing; I personally suggest you try the pancakes, the Jollof rice with shrimps in oyster sauce, BBQ wings, as well as the croaker fish in pepper sauce. Lovely mocktails too.  The atmosphere was great and the ocean view was extremely refreshing as the water was clean and had no rubbish in it.   There was an area for volleyball, swimming, snooker, outdoor dining and even painting. We got to take our art home.

Rubbish experience,"Waste of money, and very little value for money paid. It‚Äôs annoying writing out this review because I went to Jara with the best intentions. I specifically wanted to reflect and get ready for the new year. While going in, I knew what the power schedule was going to be like. I adjusted my expectations, hoping part of their reasoning for doing this was because the breeze from the ocean helps keep you cool. WRONG. It was incredibly hot during the day and the fan barely helped. I guess what you‚Äôre thinking is, ‚Äúwell why don‚Äôt you go outside? After all, you‚Äôre at a resort.‚Äù Oh, we did prefer spending time outside, but guess what? THE FLIES. An entire army of flies, everywhere you turn.

A very enjoyable stay,"Jara should actually be given a 3 star rating in my view but I've given a 4 rating here based on the level of effort the staff members put in to ensure our stay was very enjoyable. The resort itself and surrounding scenery are beautiful, very picturesque. There are different room types depending on one's preference, lots of outdoor sit out areas for rest & relaxation, a pool, spa and direct access to the beach. The food portions are large (we very often couldn't finish the entire meal) and mostly tasted fantastic - kudos to the chef(s). During our stay there were outdoor games organised collectively for guests during the weekdays (one session during the day and another at night), I must say the host did a remarkable job in making the activities fun.

Great experience,"Food, accommodation, ambience and services were great. The only reason I am keeping a star for myself is because you have no Workout/Exercise program or routine or a gym room. Yes, there are dumbbells and skipping ropes in the big screen bar but this isn‚Äôt great especially if you have another guest who wants to play the pool or eat in that same bar at the same time another guest is sweating from an exercise.

Very disappointing!!! Poor attempt at luxury,"We booked a 2 night family trip at the villa with our 12ained, we were fobbed off that they had just pumped water and it assured it would quickly be resolved. A whole 16hrs after check-in and first complaint, issue was still not fixed.  After numerous times of pointing out the issue still had not be resolved we were offered a move to the neighbouring ‚Äúvilla‚Äù which after inspection by my husband turned out to have a similar issue with the water supply.  On the second day of our stay the hotel turned up with a plumber who claimed filters were blocked but could only resolve one tap working, poor water pressure still remained and it was pretty much impossible to shower, we were moved to a family room with reasonable water pressure.

Awesome Family Visit!,"It was my husband‚Äôs 50th birthday and we had planned a family getaway to Jara Beach Resort. We made the choice after an extensive research on reviews out there. Turned out to be a great decision! We were enthralled  by the thoughtfulness of dressing up our room to wish my husband a happy birthday. There was even a bottle of wine and balloons dropped for our celebration. I loved the cozy ambience of the accommodation. We loved the meals, the unlimited drinks and my children had great fun in the pool and outdoors. We had an evening picnic set out for us on the beach as we requested and enjoyed a nice evening out by the fire pit. We also took stunning pictures at the beach.

The worst beach resort experience ever!,"The experience was bitter sweet. I feel it was overpriced for the experience I got. So the good parts. There is free flow of alcohol from when we came in the afternoon till evening. The next morning, none would be served to you. The ambience is very calm and relaxing especially the sound of the wave which beautifully woke me up. The room is tidy with white beddings and you can smoke in the balcony. The staff are polite and helpful. The not so good part. The bathing area (room 3) was very dirty. It‚Äôs made of tiles and any resort of that price should take extra care in making sure everywhere is clean and tidy. The food wasn‚Äôt fresh at all at least the protein. They all tasted stale and kept in the refrigerator for a long time. I didn‚Äôt enjoy any of the meals. Imagine frozen fish",December 2021,,,wrote a review Dec 2021,,['1 contribution'],10,[]

Unpleasant stay,"Our stay at the resort was very unpleasant and we could not wait to go home.   The room was dirty. Dirty floors, dirty towels, stained bedlinen and chairs.

Every time I had to order something I found myself waiting for a long time without anyone attending, while you could see the staff standing in large groups chatting away.

Not worth the money paid,"Jara fell short of my expectations. The staff seem unhappy and therefore reflects in their attitude to customers. They don‚Äôt understand that the essence of your coming to their facility is to relax and not be disturbed; they constantly come to knock the room door for the most ridiculous and flimsy reasons. Not to mention the meals-  firstly, everything  on the menu is unavailable! Then, when you finally make a selection, that is also not available but at that point they don‚Äôt feel a need to explain or communicate this to the guest; they serve you whatever is in the kitchen! The meal preparation was also evidently unhygienically prepared because it purged myself and hubby‚Äôs stomach.

It felt like being in my own private resort. The food was awesome, the sound of the ocean at night was refreshing. It was trully an unforgettable experience Thumbs up!!!",July 2020,,,wrote a review Jul 2020,,['1 contribution'],50,[]
Extremely flawed guest relations,"I looked forward to my trip with a friend, it was his birthday and I decided to pay for our stay in the resort. He contacted the resort, apparently had a work relationship with one of the co-founders and made reservations in his name. I was simply excited to share this experience with him. We arrived at about 5 p.m to our room, sadly it was tiny for amazonians like us, I felt the room had a good sense of decor and styling although the balcony table was broken, toilet sitting not fixed properly, the shower wasn't working properly, we needed to get assistance each time we wanted to shower because the water was not flowing, the shower room was very tiny with a shabbily cut out piece of fabric used as the shower curtain - each time we took a shower, we needed to get someone to clean",June 2020,,,wrote a review Jun 2020,"Lagos, Nigeria","['9 contributions', '17 helpful votes']",10,[]
Such a nice peaceful environment in busy Lagos,"If you want peace and quiet, as well as some privacy in busy Lagos, then Jara is a must-consider option. You can go as an individual, as a couple or even group. We went as a small Group from Office and my team loved it. Clean environment, welcomed by very friendly and well trained staff. Food was good and so were the unlimited drinks. We did not use the rooms, but I'm sure these are very fine as well, with no doubt a beautiful view!",February 2020,,,wrote a review Feb 2020,,['1 contribution'],40,[]
Great Location for Business and Personal Retreat,"This is a great place for Management/Business Retreat or a quick weekend getaway. Great Ambiance and exceptional Service. The environment is great and the rooms are cozy. Of much importance is the view from the room. Right from your room, you can see the beach and ocean waves...",January 2020,,,wrote a review Jan 2020,,['1 contribution'],40,[]

Just wonderful!,"Jara is a superb place to relax and unwind after the rigours of Lagos.  It's not that far down the Lekki-Epe Expressway, but it feels like you are a million miles away from the city - any city!  It's there on the beach, the only noise is the waves lapping, sometimes crashing (OK, there's some quiet background music as well!).  The rooms are lovely, the food is great, and the staff are really there to make you comfortable.  One really doesn't want to leave!  As resorts go in Lagos, this is simply the best!",December 2019,,,wrote a review Dec 2019,,"['9 contributions', '18 helpful votes']",50,[]

Absolutely amazing experience,"I stayed at Jara Beach Resort with my wife. We had an amazing experience. We were welcomed with a cool glass of orange juice, after which we were shown to our comfortable room with a stunning view over the sea. The resort is beautifully decorated and has a very nice pool with cool water. And if that's not enough, the food is amazing too. The staff is very friendly and happy to attend to your needs. They even arranged a birthday cake for my wife =) I can say this was by far our best resort experience in Nigeria so far - very, very much recommended!",December 2019,,,wrote a review Dec 2019,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","['3 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",50,[]
Hidden gem near the beach,"I travelled to Jara with my husband and our baby daughter (2 years) in the end of November 2019.   Jara beach resort is a beautiful place with the sea just few meters aways. The territory is large and well protected. It has pool, beach volley ball field, table tennis and much more. In the evening you can enjoy a glass of wine at the bon fire.   It is an all-inclusive resort and they offer fine dining throughout the day. My advise is to try the famous goat banga that offers an excellent fusion of Nigerian and European cuisine.   Rooms are cosy with double bed, ac, and private bathroom. Staff is very friendly and is happy to attend to your needs.   Also Jara offers a large meeting place with presentation screen that makes it a perfect place for business retreat meetings.",November 2019,,,wrote a review Nov 2019,"St. Petersburg, Russia",['7 contributions'],50,[]
