Excellent Hotel. The only Hotel for Indian Food.,"We had stayed in Indigo Hotel for 6 days in the month of January 2015. The hotel is excellent, with very friendly staff, the rooms are huge and very neat and clean. The best part is the Vegetarian Indian food which we got was awesome.  I would recommend every one going to Lagos to stay in Indigo Hotel.",January 2015,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jun 2015,"Mumbai, India","['5 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
Hidden Gem in Lagos,"The furnishings are simple, and the place is very clean and neat -  much better then some of the other Guest houses I've stayed at in Lagos. There are 5 TV channels available, 2 of them are indian, there is a news and a sports channel.  I thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality at this place - the manager called me every evening to find out what I would like as part of the complimentary Breakfast offering as well as what I would like for Dinner.   The Food is absolutely amazing indian cuisine especially considering that you are in the heart of North West Africa!.  My Only gripe is that the Room window looks out onto the Generator and the Street which are both extremely noise and it's dificult if not impossible to get a decent nights rest - Carry Ear plugs if you want to sleep at",June 2015,Traveled on business,"All the rooms would generally be noisy, Room 5 has 2 Queen size beds, I was given this room even...",wrote a review Jun 2015,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['12 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",40,"['Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_10']"
