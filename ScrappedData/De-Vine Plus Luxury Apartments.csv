Good Hotel and Atmosphere,Hotel is good. Rooms are spacious. Staff very friendly and other guests make the atmosphere good. There are resident customers there who are very friendly. Good Hotel for the price and near the centre of Ikeja.,August 2013,Traveled on business,This is near Ikejy in Lagos so if you are working there it saves a lot of travelling time,wrote a review Sep 2013,Lagos,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Rooms bubble_30', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"
Thank God,"I stayed at Devine between end of March and 1st of April 2012.it was recommended by my brother who had stayed there before.i checked in after spending a night at Lagos Airport Hotel and was glad I moved over to Devine .The manager Auntie Bose as i referred to her is very friendly and approachable,the room was clean,fresh, and tastefully furnished. Staff are very friendly ,though in a residential estate the hotel was quite and peaceful.the breakfast menu was far tastier and better presented compared to the airport hotel and wireless Internet was also free compared to airport hotel . I am looking forward to staying there when next I visit Nigeria.",April 2012,,,wrote a review Apr 2012,,"['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
typical Nigerian service,"I have been to Nigeria a few times and stayed in most hotels in lagos. De Vine appartments is not the worst place you can stay in but also not the best. Your experience will depend on what room you are going to get, I have travelled with my collegues and we had to travel in and out of Lagos and I probably have stayed in all of the rooms there. Some rooms are terrible with leaking and noisy air con, insects but some are ok and pretty decent. Majority of the rooms are taken by Aric (the wings of Nigeria) crew and you can hardly see any female guests in the hotel so it can be quite intimidating if you are a woman. The restaurant part of the hotel doesn't really exist, it is just a room where you can get some ridiculously overpriced food and beer. The service doesn't really exisits",November 2009,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Nov 2009,"England, United Kingdom","['48 contributions', '13 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_10', 'Rooms bubble_30', 'Location bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_20']"
bloody expensive,These apartments are one of a number springing up in Lagos. It costs around 150 dollars a nite for a moderate room which are generally clean.  Food prices are diabolical and cost around 16-25 dollars for a very poor plateful of food. As usual in Nigeria there is no concept of good service and complaints about food are just generally shrugged off. Its in a quiet area and is safe and used by air crew of Arik. Lagos is fast becoming a damn expensive city to do busines.,June 2009,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jul 2009,lancashire,"['30 contributions', '41 helpful votes']",20,"['Value bubble_10', 'Rooms bubble_20', 'Location bubble_20', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_10']"
The worst,"Location - not a great place Service - people smile but have no idea what service is and hate it when you ask for something Internet - always a problem Most expensive food for what you get.  they call it a steak, but really I would say ""road Kill""",February 2008,,,wrote a review Feb 2008,Lagos,"['6 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",10,[]
