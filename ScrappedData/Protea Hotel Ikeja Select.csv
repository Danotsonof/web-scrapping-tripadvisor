Good value for the money,The hotel is perfectly located in relation to the airport and access to the major roads to various destinations. Located in an area with little city noise. Close by a shopping mall. The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is not new and that can be seen from the rooms. But rooms are clean and room service efficient.,June 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jun 2023,"Svenstrup, Denmark","['92 contributions', '33 helpful votes']",40,[]
Worst Experience,"Check In: We walked in to the hotel without prior reservation and we want to check the room category before the process all i heard from the Associate is we cannot show the rooms in such rude tone. you can check the rooms in the TV screen. What a warm welcome would rate Zero as check in experience.   Same Associate mentioned a wrong figure for the room charges and we transferred the payment through third party as they advised their exchange rate is too low.   Room are not too spacious but cleaning wise is good.  Breakfast spread is small but chefs are good.  Check out Experience: pathetic, Because of the miscommunication we ended up paying more and they were supposed to do the refund as they mentioned it will be refunded back to the account received and as per my request we met",April 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review May 2023,,"['8 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",10,"['Value bubble_10', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_10']"

"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location","For a stay in Lagos Nigeria, this is a great hotel (I travel a lot and have been to the best resorts in Europe). I didn't expect the level of attention and service we received but we were wowed by the staff. Clean and modern hotel, perfect location for getting around lagos. The mall across the road was an added bonus with lots of places to eat and shop. When we had a misunderstanding with one of the staff, the manager  Margaret ensured it was resolved in a timely manner and even made it up to us.  Hotel food was great and room service was efficient.

The Staff At This Hotel Are Assets,"I spent 7 nights at Protea Hotel Ikeja Select. It was a trip I had made with my wife - who made made the pick of this hotel & done the booking.  Anie (the Hotel Manager) attended to us at the reception. She went above & beyond to receive is and make us feel welcome. This lady maintained superb consistency in terms of customer service through out our stay. She deserves to work in the best hotels in the world - She is ""a natural"" with guests.  The room was okay - Room 138. There was an issue with the hotel floor and water leaked on the floor when we flushed. Beyond that the hotel staff were there to attend to our every need.  I liked the proximity to Shoprite.  I will definitely be returning and would love to stay in this hotel again. It gave me value for my money.

Disappointed Customer,I was swayed towards this Hotel by some good reviews on Trip Advisor but was soon to find out i had made a huge mis judgement. I stayed for 2 nights Saturday 2/10/21 and Sunday 3/10/21. Checking in was slow as i was stuck behind a complete air crew checking in and there are only 2 check in desks at the hotel. The reception area doubles as  a meeting area with a small bar. Te dining room is tiny likewise the breakfast room. There is an outside space with a pool but very tight for sitting out. i was entertaining a client on Saturday evening so we gleefully had a drink at the bar whilst reviewing the menu which is al a carte no buffet which is unusual for a hotel i Lagos.

So far off the mark,"Staff are friendly but totally clueless about every little question. Room door doesn't latch at all, so anyone can push the door open. BBQ at night was so so. Leather style beef, dry chicken. Spicy chicken soup was delicious as was the chili sauce. Veggies cooked to death. Salad sauce ran out and when staff was aboard they did absolutely nothing apart from saying OK. Trying to get a decent fried egg at breakfast seems an impossibility. Understanding that there is a difference between cream (double cream or heavy cream) and full cream milk-forget it. The beef is a hard as a plank of wood. Lagos seems to think this standard is ok. Doesn't say much for the city and its people (patrons).",September 2019,,,wrote a review Sep 2019,"Nairobi, Kenya","['405 contributions', '83 helpful votes']",10,[]

Would stay again but needs improvement.,"The good: The food was great. The staff at reception desk was very helpful. Particularly the gentleman that works the graveyard shift (gets off at 7am). He assisted me occasionally and was always welcoming. They have some events at night by the pool area that’s pretty cool. (If you’re not trying to sleep). I liked the breakfast buffet and they take security seriously. The bed was very firm and comfy. Also loved the showers water pressure.   The bad: Upon checking into my room I saw a candy wrapper on the floor. Other than that, it looked clean. However, a hotel worth her salt wouldn’t make this kind of mistake. There was a strand of hair on my bed and also a pair of socks under the bed. (Didn’t even realize about the socks until the next day.. and no, it wasn’t mine).

Breakfast is divine. I have stayed here for years since it opened and I have never had any cause to regret it.  Unlike most places that offer Croaker or Catfish - these guys go all the way to grill the most exquisite BARRACUDA fish.  The central Air conditioning is a problem - TOO COLD!!!

BEWARE FRIDAY NIGHT NoISE,VENUE  The hotel is situated in Ikeja The seat of government and so is very convenient in that regard and was easy to find as it is on the main road. Ikeja is close to the main international airport which is in the same area. The Shoprite shopping mall is right opposite the hotel so plenty of shopping nearby.   SECURITY  Our car was screened as we attempted to come through the gate and this was repeated each time we came in. The hotel is frequented by airline staff. There is an ATM machine at the entrance of the hotel - which is very thoughtful.  CHECK IN  I stayed six days. The exterior of the hotel at the entrance looked dusty and did not look as if it had seen any water at all that day.

Unfortunately my husbands ipod was stolen by room cleaning staff as we forgot to put it in the safe so beware! The restaurant food was very tasty though with a great breakfast.

OK for a couple of nights,"There is some confusion among taxi drivers about this hotel as there is apparently another in Ikeja that they seem to confuse it with. Be sure to say it's in Alausa opposite Shoprite. Despite being only 8 km from the airport, it took me 25 mins to get there (at 9 pm) and could take longer in the rush hour.  I had booked online and the room was priced in USD, as was my confirmation. But on check-in I was asked to pay in NGN. So why not quote in NGN in the first place? That sort of thing causes a lot headaches with picky accountants handling expense claims.  My ground floor room was good. Great 'rain shower', decent wi-fi signal, nice and quiet.

A great wee addition to Lagos,I have stayed in various Protea's across Nigeria and this is a great addition to Lagos and Ikeja.  It is located across from the International mall in Ikeja and is only 15 minutes from the airport.  It only opened last year and is obviously building up the customer base.  Located in a very secure compound and finished to a very high standard.  The rooms are small and business like but with everything you need - including free wireless.  The staff are really friendly and welcoming and the breakfast is very good!  I will definitely use this hotel again when working in Lagos.  It is also very well priced for Lagos at about £150 per night.,June 2015,,,wrote a review Jun 2015,"Dunblane, United Kingdom","['127 contributions', '93 helpful votes']",40,[]

Always on point,"Iv become a part of the protea family  as i make it an aim to come here twice a month. For whilst sone call it Africa, I call it home. I love the freindly staff at this hotel and il mention a few, the chef, Jones , waiter vincent, and michael from the reception make life easy. The last time we had a pool party and the managers were soo happy they offered us  a free barbercue and drinks. Its not really the fanciest place to be as its located far from any tourist attractions. It however has a mall nearby which is convenient as its  just across their road. Im a sucker for peace and quiet as i value my rest above everything. If youre like me this is your place. Despite their food being scrumciously delicious, they offer a free breakfast which is overly nice and i promise you i can",June 2015,,,wrote a review Jun 2015,"Doha, Ad Dawhah, Qatar",['12 contributions'],40,[]
Great location,"Excellent location close to everything, especially the airport. Rooms are good, neat, claen and funcional. Wifi is excellent. Staff are very friendly and helpful and service is good. Tawo who works at the bar and restuarant gives excellent service. Breakfast choice is wide and dinner buffet is good with different selections each night. If you order off the menu though expect to wait a long time. They are not really eqipped for this. The only thing I didn't lie was the extremely hard matress on the bed. It was like sleeping on a board!",June 2015,,,wrote a review Jun 2015,"Cape Town Central, South Africa","['23 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",40,[]

Very Good,This hotel is perfect for Nigeria/Lagos. The most important thing is hotel is really clean and luxury. Everthing is same as the pictures. And hotel has a new building. If you are not realy really sensitive you can eat the meats. Taste is very good for me. Also you should try the fruits. You have all time electricity and this is very important here. If you will visit Lagos you can stay at this hotel here nothing will be problem.,March 2015,,,wrote a review Mar 2015,,"['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",40,[]
"A friendly, clean and comfortable place, in the right location and at the right price","Great location in central Ikeja, brand new, super friendly and helpful staff, clean and comfortable.  It has everything a business traveler needs in a hotel, feels like an expensive hotel, but at a very affordable rate.  I will stay there every time I come to Lagos now as will all my teammates.  It is a diamond in the rough.  Don't, however, come here expecting a destination bar and restaurant or other fancy amenities.  They have all these things - restaurant, bar, pool, gym, business center, etc. - but they are minimal and you know what?  That's just perfect for me as a business traveler.  The food is very good, the drinks are reasonable and they treat you like an old friend.  What else could you ask for?",December 2014,,,wrote a review Jan 2015,"Accra, Ghana","['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",40,[]
"A quiet, cosy gem of a hotel, close to the airport","This is a great hotel - it is small, comfortable and very close to the airport.  The hotel is new, and  finding its feet but the staff are very friendly and helpful, and management is very visible all the time.  There is the Ikeja shopping mall literally across the road - so an added bonus!",December 2014,,,wrote a review Dec 2014,Cape Town,"['64 contributions', '39 helpful votes']",40,[]
