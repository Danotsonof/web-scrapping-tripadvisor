3 nights spread across a week and half,"On the second morning of my first stay we had no water coming through and had to get a staff to bring up buckets of water. When I thought had seeing it all, on my next stay with my girls our room was filled with roaches it was unbelievable. We literally found them everywhere. One thing though...the staffs were pleasant and polite.",April 2018,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review May 2018,,"['96 contributions', '9 helpful votes']",20,[]
NBAAGC2017,The facility is in top shape and neat and the staff are friendly and reliable. We had a slight issue about our bookings but was sorted out. They respond promptly to us. The facility is in a secured area and very close to the palms. The food is a bit pricey but you can always eat out or order from online restaurants. Its a lovely place to stay.,August 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2017,,"['7 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",40,[]
