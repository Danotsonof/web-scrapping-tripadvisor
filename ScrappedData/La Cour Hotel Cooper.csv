A good Place for Family Relaxation,Located in the serene and quiet location in Ikoyi. We stayed in a two-bedroom suite. It has a big living room. Very clean rooms all en-suite. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Prompt response from staff in sorting out our concerns. The breakfast was modest....choices not much. Good choices for Lunch and dinner. The swimming pool was clean. My boys were thrilled about the pool. The WiFi was however nothing to write home about. We could not use it despite the effort of the staff at fixing it (We relied on the internet from our phones). The air conditioner in the living room and one of the rooms did not work all through our stay (The functional one tend to make our stay comfortable).

"We always enjoy La Cour Boutique Hotel, Cooper Road, Ikoyi","Our company has always enjoyed the very quiet & cozy La Cour Boutique Hotel at Cooper Road. The service from all staff is so good, the food is excellent & the rooms are spacious & of a quality which is not as common as one would wish in Nigeria. Most of the time guest would meet the management, which is always on hand for a chat & open for suggestions. Some years ago breakfast needed an upgrade, this was mentioned & ever since breakfast has been something I look forward to. Dinners are also good, resident or not, & I recommend the barracuda, which is done very well here. It's cozy surrounding, easy parking & possibility for long enjoyable walks around Ikoyi is just an added feature. For me it's definitely like coming home when I enter La Cour.

green hide away,"I stayed there for 3 weeks:  Things I really liked: breakfast (good cereals, lots of fruits, choice of cheese) & pool (clean, big enough for some exercise).  Since the manager has German origins, the influence was very well reflected in the menu card, which had lots of choices. Food was by and large very good. Service team was dedicated.  The music played at the restaurant consisted of a very limited number of 80/90 chart hits from Germany. Hearing them every day was a pain in the ears.  The rooms are big, although not cosy, but I have never seen a cosy room around equatorial Africa. Some minor things to be considered: if you like it quiet, check a room away from the generator.

"Friendly, comfortable and just the job :-)","I am a regular business traveller to Lagos and till this last visit have always stayed in one of the 'big international' hotels on Victoria Island. This is my first stay in a smaller hotel on Ikoyi. In summary I will be returning. The hotel is nicely tucked out the way and feels secure behind high walls and solid metal gates that are locked of an evening and covered by 24/7 security. The gardens are something else and full of life, greenery and colour. It really does add to the boutique look and feel of the place. Rooms are of a really good size with working A/C and pretty good internet access. I stayed in a deluxe room with a fridge and kitchenette type area. There were TV's in both the lounge and bedroom.

Nice Boutique Hotel,"I have stayed now several times at this hotel. It's a true boutique hotel, a very nice entry with lots of green, the rooms are large 1-bedroom apartments. The rooms do sometimes smell a bit damp, like no one has stayed in the rooms for some time and the doors and windows have been locked with the AC's off.  The rooms are overall fairly clean, however I have seen bedsheets with holes in it. Complimentary water is given, but you need to ask for it. The TV channels in the room are rather limited, they could get a broader DSTV subscription. The internet seems to have improved recently, it was a lot worse before which makes it rather hard to work from the room if you're internet business dependent.

Another fantastic weekend away at Oasis La Cour,"A friend and I stayed over a weekend to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Once again we were looked after and treated like royalty. The room was like an apartment with 2 bedrooms en suite, clean and well serviced. Breakfast was a treat and other meals ordered from the menu very tasty and filling. Can’t fault the staff, very well trained and knowledgeable and friendly. Front desk a pleasure. Felt safe and secure with friendly guards at the gates. Great prices and rates.

Good for long stay in Lagos,"Stayed here for 3 weeks while on a business trip to Lagos.   While the hotel doesn't have the ""luxuries"" of other ""bigger"" hotels it really is perfect for longer stays and cheaper.   Staff are very polite, friendly and accommodating. Rooms have a little lounge area (very uncomfortable couches and furniture though) a bathroom with shower and a separate bedroom.   5 or 6 TV channels are in both lounge and bedroom and there is also a little desk and a bar fridge in the rooms - allowing you to bring in some treats from the nearby shop and not always have to rely on the hotels food.

It's okay....but....,"The hotel itself is okay. Rooms are clean but feel a bit dark and cavernous.   Security is good and the welcome is warm. The hotel food is excellent.   I can't comment on the value for money front as it was a business trip paid for by others. The staff are nice, but it would help if they showed you to your room.   I don't like hotels in Africa that don't give you mosquito nets. I don't want my room sprayed. I prefer the security of a net.

Coffee morning at La Cour Cooper,This was our first visit as a group for coffee at La Cour.  The entrance is well hidden but once inside there are lovely gardens and greenery.

Definitely an Oasis in Lagos,"I am a member of a multi national group of ladies living in Lagos (many of us for over 20 years), who use La Cour Hotel on Cooper Road, Ikoyi as a venue to play Bridge twice a week.  Members of our group regularly lunch at the hotel prior to playing Bridge and we also regularly use the hotel restaurant for our group lunches.    The food is always excellent and well priced.    The staff at the hotel are friendly and efficient, often greeting each of us by name after only one or two meetings.    Such attention to personal detail is rare and should be highly commended.

Excellent Food,"The restaurant at La Cour In Cooper road is excellent. They have a nice bar area and the dinning room are side by side. It is in a quiet discreet part of Ikoyi with with lush trees making it a nice place to sit, relax and spend an evening starting with a drink and following through with a meal.

It was a wonderful call as the rooms cannot be called rooms but rather suites.  They are spacious and nicely set out. They are well equiped with kettle and a small bar fridge.   The staff were  very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble.  It was a pleasure to return to the hotel every day as it has a friendly atmosphere.  It is a haven of order cleanliness and good service.  The airconditioning was very effective and the bathrooms modern and clean.  I would highly recommend the hotel.  I found the travel from Ikoyi onto Victoria Island  relatively easy and really enjoyed the garden atmosphere of the hotel.",June 2012,,,wrote a review Jun 2012,"Lagos, Lagos, Ni","['39 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",50,[]
Great boutique-type hotel on Lagos Island - nice alternative!,"La Cour is a relative new boutique-type hotel situated on the central Lagos Island and only about 6 kilometres from the heart Lagos. This hotel has surprised me!  The rooms are in an apartment format with separate bedroom and lounge that are really large and comfortable. There is small desk with surprisingly fast (free) cable ADSL internet, a fridge, coffee station, lounge suite, with two flat screens TVs and dual air conditions in both the bedroom and lounge. Limited but functional DSTV channels, including two international English news channels  The queen bed was comfortable and my only small problem was to have waited for 5 minutes every morning before the warm water arrived in the shower! The bathroom's craftmanship was very sloppy, i.e. shower leaking a bit onto the tiled",April 2012,,,wrote a review Apr 2012,"Pretoria, South Africa","['234 contributions', '94 helpful votes']",40,[]
