A dishonest place,"An awful hotel, certainly not 5 star. The services are below par and the rooms are not cleaned properly. We stayed here for 3 days we were due to stay for 7 but it was too much like torture. The sound proofing is poor, the food is mediocre and the overall sense is a money grabbing operation with disinterested owners/ managers. The only plus is the gardens. The 5 star rating is a joke, This place is ran by dishonest people, additional charges taken, wrong orders given delays in food service, low quality and overpriced. Breakfast was like a case study in how not to present food - totally underwhelming.  Be prepared for outrageous responses from Managers who cannot accept their place is sub par so they lie. Not a place for discerning customers.",April 2021,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2021,,"['7 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",10,"['Rooms bubble_10', 'Cleanliness bubble_10', 'Service bubble_10']"

Worst hotel ever in Lagos,"No no no I not advise anyone to live there. it is just a building. no lift no swimming pool. what type of hotel is this? People at hotel are very rude. Asks money every time.  After cleaning my room one of staff asked in very low sound - anything for me? Later I gave him $10. Room was quite big in size but night was horrible. It was not sound proof. I heard sex moaning all the night. I felt next door couple took viagra. No breakfast buffet at all. I waited for Spanish omelet for around 30 minutes. When I tried to call the manager. No manager. Worst hospitality in Lagos. Do not know how and why people said it top class hotel or five star rating place. I and my hubby extremely disappointed with this hotel. Full of mosquitos, restaurant was empty and service was very late.

Very substandard,"We stayed here based on convenience and took on board the reviews which seemed acceptable at face value.  Unfortunately it was a horrible experience, the place lacked in so many areas.   The room had giant ants. The bathroom had no blind or curtains, the room was dark and depressing. It is set in natural beautiful gardens which are pleasant but that’s the only redeeming feature. The food was abysmal very poorly cooked with zero taste and it was expensive.   Staff were cold and lacked that professionalism which you’d expect in a hotel.

Fantastic for retreats - Personal or Couple,"The room was okay. The bed was comfortable. There was a jacuzzi in the bathroom which made for extra relaxation. There was also a lot of space in the bathroom so you could actually sit there and think or read, or have a personal time if there's someone else in the room.  The fragrance in the facility was really soothing and relaxing. There are sit-outs (little huts) surrounded by plants and equipped with fans so it stays cool and keeps you feeling quite in touch with nature.   The environment  just aids your creativity.

An Escape from Lagos...in Lagos!,"I'm torn in reviewing this hotel. On one hand, I loved my stay. On the other hand, the more people who find out about it, the harder it will be for me to reserve a room in the future!   But at a certain point, you have to share great things with the rest of the world.   California Clear Essence is one of the best kept secrets in Lagos.   Their plush landscape drowns out the hustle and bustle of Lagos traffic. You may never want to leave. But if you do, its conveniently located in a very accessible part of Ikoyi (5 mins to Lekki, 10 mins to V.I. with no traffic).  Don't leave without booking a spa treatment. They have an entire separate building dedicated to it!   In short, California Clear Essence is a steal. Book a stay here. You will actually leave feeling more calm, more",September 2019,,,wrote a review Sep 2019,"Lagos, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],50,[]

"Great value for money, very close to a 5 star experience for a 3 star price.","Small, boutique hotel in Ikoyi, so relatively quiet by Lagos standards. Rooms are spacious and clean and the beds are really nice. What really stands out though is the service, I have never found hotel staff this friendly, efficient and helpful in Lagos in the 20-odd years I've been visiting there. They really elevate this place and make it special.  A few tiny things that would make this a fully 5 star experience for me: - slightly better range of channels on the TV - filter coffee at the breakfast buffet - better wifi coverage, it only worked in half my room - A swimming pool:) (ok not a tiny thing but I can wish)  But these are details, overall I think after twenty years I've found my Lagos hotel...",July 2019,,,wrote a review Aug 2019,"Johannesburg, South Africa",['1 contribution'],50,[]

Amazing As Always,I have stayed in lots of hotels and I must say my stay in clear essence was amazing as always. No complaints. Hotel is located along Alexander Avenue in Ikoyi not too far from the Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Rooms are spacious and clean. One thing I would also recommend is to probably include local Nigerian dishes in the menu.,June 2019,,,wrote a review Jun 2019,,['1 contribution'],50,[]

Wonderful Experience...,"Myself and my wife had a wonderful experience during our stay. We needed to get away to a serene quiet environment and this resort was just perfect. peaceful, quiet with a little bit of nature.  Wonderful service, tasteful room and bathroom was awesome. Central location to go towards, the mainland, VI and Lekki. Amenities were beautiful and in working condition.  I liked the lovely green serene the most; however, I believe the room service fee should be eliminated.

Mixed experience,"I usually stay at the Southern Sun whenever I am in Lagos for board meetings. In 2018, I had told the management of Southern Sun if they did not renovate their hotel, I was not staying there. Fast forward 2019, the renovation has still not been done. So I decided to try somewhere else. Clear Essence came to mind.   I decided to try my luck and I embarked on my experience with this hotel. Arrival was good. I was a bit disappointed with the parking space. However, the warmth I received from staff calmed t reservations. I make my booking initially for six (6) days.

Service gone downhill,"I'm knocking a star off from my earlier review down to 3 stars - over customer service. I and my partner were here during the holidays but we didn't feel very welcomed particularly whenever we requested for room service. The gentleman who delivered silverware/plates to our room didn't particularly look happy each time he showed up. Could just be his personality but we couldn't help but feel unwelcomed. I was nice and thankful with a smiley face each time he made deliveries but he would simply turn away with a countenance that was hard to read.

Hidden Gem,"Not the easiest of places to locate -- but with Google maps we were able to navigate our way here.There is also no sign board outside -- but again, perhaps only certain clientele with knowledge about this establishment know how to find them.  Once inside, the aromatic smell was welcoming -- true to it's name :). The rooms are spaciously sized and clean. The location is great and the price point appears reasonable for Lagos in terms of ROI considering the location. Customer service was great: from our first night to departure. We had a slight water leak on our ceiling the first night and had to be moved immediately, so that wasn't a big of an issue.

Excellent Oasis in the heart of Lagos,"I stayed at Clear Essence recently with a large group who had travelled in from all over the world, Europe, USA, Ghana etc. without exception, all of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The property was clean, stylish & calm. The food was excellent, but by far the most impressive part of my stay was the level of service. The staff were polite, effective & genuinely gracious & happy. This resort is truly a credit to the city.

"Parents reception for African Leadership academy, South Africa","What a lovely and beautiful hideaway.  I was blown away by the decor, the deliberate attention to detail for every thing. The staff were ever so helpful and continued to offer us such attention up to the very end. I have never been to a hotel in Nigerian that has been so generous with their time, resources and kindness.  I will certainly be coming back to Clear essence with my business and also for my personal enjoyment.  Thank you all for such a wonderful opportunity to hot our parents reception in your hotel.

A lovely oasis in a busy city,Customer service was impeccable. All the staff went out of their way to deal with all our requests.  The rooms were clean and all the ambiance made you feel relaxed . The spa treatments were some of the best I have experienced. The slight let down was the limited menu for lunch and dinner and no African food s served in the restaurant,March 2016,,,wrote a review Mar 2016,"London, United Kingdom","['3 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",50,[]
A home away from home,"We stayed here for 3 nights. A small boutique hotel and spa. Staff were friendly, room was clean, and it was well positioned. There was no safe in the room. The Wifi is very fast and available throughout the property. We arrived late on the first night so had dinner there too, food was very good, but comes at hotel prices. They also arranged for an airport transfer with their own driver at an additional cost. Only thing missing for me was a swimmingpool, would have enjoyed the stay so much more if there was one.",February 2016,,,wrote a review Feb 2016,Sunny Cape Town,"['48 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",40,[]

"Very comfortable, clean and good service.","I was surprised to find a hotel in Nigeria that was so good, and that made me very comfortable. Its location on a main avenue, makes its access easy, though we nearly missed its entrance from the main road. Its design is nice, the rooms are clean. I faced 2 minor problems: -I had a problem with the hot water as it needed 20 mins to become hot. When asked for service, the maintenance guy told me that my room was at the end of the line and it was normal. -The generator of the hotel was very close to my room and it was noisy when it was on.  Breakfast is good, the restaurant as well. i particularly enjoyed the lamb chops. Then you can get to relax in the amazing garden they have. Unfortunately, i didn't get to try the spa. Most probably next time. Would recommend it for sure.",November 2015,,,wrote a review Nov 2015,"Antelias, Lebanon","['41 contributions', '21 helpful votes']",40,[]
Weekend getaway,"We booked this hotel for our anniversary in 2013. You get that secluded feeling once you enter and the ambience is really nice. The room we were given had one of those jacuzzi type tubs but it wasn't working so we had to be moved to another room. The second room had a shower but it worked fine. Service was good, food was good and the Spa facility was really nice but the unfortunately their cable network had issues throughout our stay so we couldn't watch TV which really dampened things",July 2014,,,wrote a review Jun 2015,"Lagos, Nigeria","['33 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",30,[]

Excellent place must visit,"Beautiful boutique hotel nestled in landscaped gardens , its so private that it doesn't even have a sign board so it's a bit difficult to find. Beautiful rooms , tastefully done doesn't feel like a hotel but like a very upmarket residence, I must admit the pictures on trip advisor do not do justice to the place. The food is excellent, the staff is very friendly the alcohol is priced far too high as well as the spa, but the spa is clean and the therepists are focussed towards their work.

Quite relaxing great Spa in Lagos,"I never stayed at the hotel, but the Clearessence spa is a great place to go for relaxing and have quality treatments. I tried massages and facial and was very satisfied with all of them plus the spa is located in the lovely garden of the hotel which makes you disconnect from the busy life of the city.

Home away from home in Lagos,"Our entire team of 6 from Bangalore stayed in this nice boutique hotel.  A good place for Indians to stay.  Rooms are very cosy. The only issue is the pressure from the shower - there is hardly any and the very minute adjustment for hot and cold water makes it worse.  Food is off the highest quality, with the Chef Shijil from God's own country, serving a variety we simply were stunned by - did not repeat a single sabji  for dinner over the period of 15 days we were there.  Diferrent desserts from time to time topped off the wonderful cuisine.  In a country where due to safety, one is confined to the indoors, we missed a swimming pool in a hot and humid city.  Otherwise, well landscaped and very well maintained. Staff is friendly and quick to respond to your needs.  Overall a",November 2013,,,wrote a review Dec 2013,Bangalore,['2 contributions'],40,[]
Lovely Hotel (Landscape/Interior) Terrible Customer Service!!,"I decided to stay at the Clear Essence because of the lovely reviews that I had seen online. I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Clear Essence and will definitely not choose this hotel for my future visits to Lagos. A number of incidents occurred that I made the staff aware of at the Front Desk but nothing was done about this. While I must say the rooms and the overall appearance of the hotel are lovely, in particular the landscape - really beautiful, however the service is what lets this hotel down.   Unprofessional Conduct   We were given a quote for the entire stay (2 weeks) and this was settled before we even arrived so that we would only have to bother about paying for room service upon check out.

Excellent Place though its not a resort at all,"I booked my self in to the place assuming its a resort however i found out later that they only had a SPA. The place even doesn't have a swimming pool. Its a very small hotel (17 rooms only) only 1 small restaurant and a bar.  However its a very cozy place. The staff is very helpful and once you stay here for a few days it feels like being home. The quality of the food is very good especially the spicy chicken curry and the internet is also very fast. The laundry service is also excellent.

Glad we found a fab place to stay,"Me, my partner and our friends stayed here for three nights recently, and can happily say we had a fab experience. On arriving we were seen to straight away and everyone spoke great english and gave warm welcome ,offered flavored welcome drink. The rooms were clean, comfy, wi fi enabled...everything and more you need in a city hotel. House-keeping attended the room every morning. The bar in the lobby was a nice place to meet up, and most of the staff were really helpful. Of course the view of the beautiful garden from the lobby was one attraction.Having a dinner under the sky at peaceful place with light instrumental music gives great feeling and makes place more romantic.

Average Experience,Stayed at the Clear Essence for one night with my wife on our anniversary. Our stay wasn't quite long enough to give a very well considered view of the hotel but the hotel is a small boutique hotel with a very nice ambience. It is very clean and the landscaping is quite good.  The rooms are quite spacious for most hotels in Lagos but in the morning I had trouble getting hot water to run. Had to take a shower with water below lukewarm. Nice spa treatments are available but are quite expensive so come with enough to spend if you want to enjoy the spa experience.  It is a small quiet hotel next to most places you will want to take a short drive to on the island. I will recommend it to young couples who just want to get away from noisy Lagos.,January 2013,,,wrote a review Feb 2013,"Lagos, Nigeria","['167 contributions', '99 helpful votes']",30,[]
Best Place to Stay in Lagos,"I was in Lagos on a business trip and was put i this hotel by my company. The rooms are beautiful,clean and new. State of the art electronics and furniture, reminded me of the W hotel in Westwood California. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I had a spa pedicure and manicure the lady took 1 hour on my feet alone. It was amazing. Only a few guests which I am not surprised, not just anyone can stay here it is very expensive. Yet and still it is better then the Sheraton 100 times over and way more secure and private.

Nightmare Stay,"We booked for couple's getaway a month in advance and it was for over $1000 for a night.  When we got there the room was not ready and when we were finally allocated a room, it had no running water, no telephone and got the welcome cocktail after an hour.  We then went to their spas, it was well organised although we were left still wanting.  We then ordered a snack which came very oily(oil running all over) although they emphasise on healthy eating on their website.  We were the only guest at the hotel and we ordered dinner in their restaurant and we got it an hour later and we could hear people shouting at each other in the kitchen from were we were sitting.

Tranquility in the ultimate city of hustle & bustle...LAGOS!,"Stayed here for 4 nights in January while in Lagos for business.  This was near the tail end of a hectic 6 countries in 2 week trip, and as much as i love love love the ""hustlers paradise"" of Lagos, i wanted a hotel to get away from it all when i wanted.  So a client recommended this place in Ikoyi, Lagos.  It's in a rather residential area, and it looks like a large mansion that has been turned in to a small boutique spa.  GREAT!  This was a place i got come back too after a hectic day/night of hustle in Lagos, and relax.  Their new GM is an English guy with great experience in the biz, and their service was brilliant.

Poor SPA Service,"I have booked an appointment at spa. I was nicely meat by the reception ladies and directed to the spa. It looks nice, more or less clean, some walls require painting and cleaning, but never mind.. I had started my procedure and really liked the quality of work, but suddenly the relaxation music started to stumble and I was left alone for about 20 minutes in the room with the scratched disc music! Instead to enjoy and relax it really made me nervous, I finally found a switch on the wall and switched it off by my self. What a horrible experience.
