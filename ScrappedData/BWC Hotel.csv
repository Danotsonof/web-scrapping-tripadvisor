Good place but needs an upgrade.,This hotel seems to have been better in the past. From the poorly motivated staff to seemingly increasing maintenance issues. The rest rooms appear rather small for a public place. It also has some parking space and conference rooms but furniture are not ergonomic. Audiovisuals maily a projector. Their food is good but the environment needs an upgrade.,May 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review May 2023,"Abuja, Nigeria","['27 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",20,[]

Review,BwC Is a good hotel. Had a nice time during my brief business trip to the hotel. The staff are quite welcoming and nice.

Dated Hotel,"I made the singular mistake of booking this hotel based on the standard of other Best Western hotels I have stayed in. This was a big mistake.   I stayed in an ""executive"" room allegedly priced at N70,000 but was said to be discounted at N30,000. I thought I was getting a good deal until I checked in. It was a rip off. Broken shower doors, no hot water, poor room aesthetic. This was a bad joke taken too far. Judging by the room I stayed this hotel is in need of an urgent makeover.  The only reason I'm giving this hotel a 2 star is on account of the complimentary breakfast. It was great. An amazing spread, good restaurant ambience and courteous staff. I score them high on this.   I couldn't wait to check out of this hotel the very next day. I won't be returning anytime soon.",August 2019,,,wrote a review Sep 2019,"Asaba, Nigeria","['19 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",20,[]
Amazing Experience,"Checked into BWC on a bright Saturday morning, i was welcomed by staff who all had smiles, very courteous and willing to assist. Rooms were extra neat, smelled nice and sand couldn't be felt on the floor. Talking about the meals.. Wow.. From the Complimentary breakfast buffet (not a breakfast person) but I had to eat breakfast every morning cause the pancake, fish stew,  gizzard stew tasted amazing. The staff make guest feel at home, they patiently listened to every complaint if any and found a way to resolve it. Truth be told I found a new family with BWC staff and when leaving I felt sad. But for sure I will return. 6nights spent at BWC and it was worth every penny. This is a place like home..

Decent hotel and restaurant,"I stayed in Room 504.  The hotel is perfectly adequate for somewhere to stay in Lagos.  The bedroom was very large, and the bathroom also a generous size.  There is a TV, armchairs, large desk, coffee-making facilities, small fridge (handy to store the two free bottles of water supplied every day; can't drink tap water here), closet, bag rack and plenty of handy power sockets.  There is no in-room safe.  The bathroom has a separate bath and shower.  A hair dryer is supplied.  The water pressure in the shower was not the best, but adequate to have a shower and wash my hair.  The air conditioning was always on when I returned to the hotel at the end of the day, so maybe they keep it on all day, which seems a bit crazy.    The restaurant is OK.

My birthday party,"I had a party for about 40 people. They helped me source the decorator and dj. The party was in the courtyard, which was quite spacious but i would advise that future parties should be at night. It looked very nice in the evening. The food was quite tasty and more than enough. The aroni nice didn't taste it though. They organised the drinks very well. They assisted the cake person in setting up. There was enough parking space. I didn't have to do anything but show up. Even though my guests came in late they all commented that the party was fabulous. The staff members were really nice. They even gave us take away packs for the remaining food.

"HOME, AWAY FROM HOME.","Cumulatively,I spent about 200 days here in 2017 --JAN-DEC and I am back again. Why? BWC has an aura and perfect ambiance that makes one come back. The front desk officers are alluring and ever willing to assist. They are on top of their jobs.  The hotel amenities are all functional and functioning too and I must add here that I never experienced power outage throughout my stay. The meals are good, the stewards are marvelous and the bar, with its soothing music, is exceptional. I have not experienced any security breach to date. The hotel has a gym and a semi standard swimming pool. SEE WHY I KEEP COMING BACK?",February 2017,,,wrote a review Jan 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],40,[]
Welcome to lagos,"My first trip ever trip to Nigeria and BWC staff members made me feel at home from the moment I touched down at the airport.   My transport waited for me over two to three hours due to delayed flights, but they still had a welcoming and warm attitude when we met.   When I got to the hotel I was received very well and and treated like a star.  Greatest spacious room with aircon great room service great food and the general attitude of helpful and service oriented staff Members who would go out of their way to make my stay more than comfortable is something out of this world.  I will not think twice to recommend this fantastic establishment to any traveler, and I most certainly will make this place my home away from home every time I visit Lagos Nigeria from here in out.",December 2017,,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"Windhoek, Namibia","['26 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]

Not a five star hotel - but you be treated like a star in this hotel,"I stayed their for 1 week to prepare and conduct a workshop. The special thing about this hotel is the willing to serve attitude that everyone in such a small hotel has. Starting the GM (who was keen to talk with guests to learn more about how to get service better and even take suggestions) down to the security personnel at the gates.  The hotel staff are willing to help you not only with answering your inquiries, but also with helping doing what you need to do.  Our participants enjoyed having the workshop at BWC Hotel as our couallgues who always conduct their workshops in there.  Prices are very acceptable and the value of what you get exceeds what you pay.  Thank you BWC Hotel for nice time!!!

Okay Hotel,"I spent one night and my overnight stay was okay. My room was on the first floor, room was clean, big and spacious, the free wifi signal my good, the shower pressure was strong. I had an event evening buffet and the food was just average, nothing fantastic.  Hotel location is accessible, you can't miss it. It is opposite the beach.

Warm and Serene Place to Lodge!!!,"I visited BWC for the first time in the first quarter of last year alone and later in the year i visited again with my wife and daughter. To be fair and honest i REALLY had a nice time! The attendants made me come back....so i came with my family...lol. I met a staff there on my second visit, Temmy or something.

Worse hotel ever,"I have been staying here for a week.  Staff is completely incompetent and there is never management on duty.  Only cater for locals. Don't even have eggs for breakfast. You can't order room service as they don't have any of the ingredients to make the items on menu. You receive room service 90 minutes after ordering and the food is ice cold. No safe in my room. No hair dryer or a plug even close to a mirror! Stay away from this hotel, the frustration and hunger pains is not worth the amount you pay. You can get better places for less!",June 2017,,,wrote a review Jun 2017,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",10,[]
Disappointed,"This is definitely not the best Best Western I've been to. Reception staff never smiled, seemed like we were bothering her. Available breakfast options were limited heavily featuring local delicacies. The few extra options, eggs and bacon, would run out by 7.30. Rooms were well sized but had a distinct damp smell coming from the hallway.

My Experience,"It was my first time of using this particular hotel, even though I've always stayed in one of the chains in Benin City.  The main problem seems to be Internet connections in some of their rooms.
