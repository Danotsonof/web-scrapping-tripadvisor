Terrible. Do not book.,"Would not recommend. Paid for 4 nights and had to leave after the first night. The hotel will not refund my money even after Expedia tried. They will deliver a terrible experience and keep your money if you decide to leave. It doesn’t matter if you have an emergency, they will keep your money which I consider a rip off. I also had a flooded bathroom and partially in the room due to water not draining in the shower and overflowing.",February 2023,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Mar 2023,"Middletown, Connecticut",['1 contribution'],10,[]

Rooms are dated,"Only stayed for a night on transit in the Deluxe room and it’s only a 40% chance that I will go back.   Location was great in a quiet neighbourhood. Pool side with views to the Lagoon is nice and the best part of the hotel.   However, the hotel needs major renovation as the rooms are quite dated.

Solo Female,"As a solo female traveller my safety is my first concern. The area isn't the most desirable so I never felt the urge to leave the hotel to go for a walk, however. The boutique hotel itself I found clean and comfortable and safe.  My first room stank to high heaven of mosquito spray but I was Jet lagged to do anything about it. Twelve hours later at 2 in the morning I stood my ground and demanded a new room,  the men on duty didn't want to upgrade me. The new room was in a wing of the hotel that wasn't being used and was dark and eerie. I again demanded to be moved and was met by the owner who was furious that a guest had been treated so poorly.

A let down,"Visited on business accompanied by my wife. Had stayed here a few times before. Came back after 7 years but the facility appears to have lowered their standards. Front office is not as clean and efficient as expected. The room smelled damp, bathroom had running water but the heater was not working. Room service was below par. Meals were average.

"Dont Even Bother!!! i repeat, dont even bother..","I am going to give as honest a review as i can, but if i were to round it off, my title says it all. I checked in with the hubby on a Sunday, we stayed for about 6 days. First, the room was so small, and the bed was even smaller. Typically, when i check into a hotel, i would do a random tour, just to make sure everything works optimally.   The air-conditioning had been working for about 20 minutes and was not cooling, then i went to the bathroom and the sink didnt have a blocker (meaning if a creepy crawly (found its way into the pipes somehow, we would have been riddled with either roaches, wall ghekos or worse case scenario -  snakes) -  this didnt happen though.

This hotel has seen better days,"Another review stated that the outside areas is the best thing this hotel has to offer, and I should have listened...  On the plus side the room was ready when we arrived at 1, and we were able to check in early.   The rooms are runs down and in need for a modernisation. The service was poor. We almost had to beg to get more than half a roll of toilet paper, but luckily we had brought some of our own.   Tre paper thin walls made it possible to hear every single guest passing in and out of their room on a Friday night maligning it impossible to get a good night of sleep.   The breakfast is perhaps ok if you are used to traditional Nigerian food, but had nothing to offer for those who prefer the continental breakfast.

Worst service experienced @ a hotel,"I purchased a standard room for 2 adults and shows on receipt (hotel.com). Room was suppose to come with bathrobe and slippers but it did not. During check-in they say room is only meant for 1 person and small meaning trying to get more money but receipt said otherwise. Also stating only 1 person can have complimentary breakfast. The room only had one normal sleeping pillow and other huge pillows. Room only came with one towel. There also needs to be some maintenance fixing of the A/C unit dripping water, the electricity sockets coming out from the wall and the sink for cold nozzle was spirting out water from air being in line.That just shows little stingy things and quality of room but this review is mainly based on the type of service presented in this establishment.

Not worth it,"Our hotel room was ok for the price but it felt like it was in great need of a renovation soon. The pillows in our room was also very hard.  The service was bad. We had to ask many times before they fixed our problems. They spent many hours getting us another towel (was only 1 in our room). The wifi in our room didn't work, and they didn't manage to give us access to it before 10:00 the next day (the day we were leaving). Breakfast was not good. The hotel has a really nice outdoor area though, where you can chill by the pool. The location of the hotel is also good.

Long Stay guest in Bon Voyage and sadly still here,"Please do a favor to yourselves and DO NOT USE this Hotel, used to be Good Now Not even 1 STAR I would Give, as  follows:  . Laundry, They don't wash it, Instead they Put the iron and send it back to your Rooms weeks in a row.  . TV and Internet Rarely works.  .

Bon voyage Safe hotel to stay.,If you travelling for 1st time to nigeria  SAFETY will be  your prime concern.  Bon voyage is very safe place to stay. Rooms are good and well maintained. Hotel is next to sea and has great pool side. From outside hotel doesn't look very great but once you enter the pool are you will feel very nice. Staff is very nice and helpful. Break fast has good variety.   I would advise you to use only hotel cab for Airport travel and local travel.  Ask for pool facing room on 2nd floor.   Negative about this hotel 1. It's too expensive USD 270 ... may be nigeria we cannot compromise on safety 2. Wifi connectivity is big issue ... I had chase hotel manager for 3 days to get it right. Make sure that wifi is working before check in.  Over all great hotel. I will stay again.,April 2014,,,wrote a review Jun 2014,"Mumbai, India","['453 contributions', '95 helpful votes']",40,[]
Won't come again,"I lasted all of three hours before I moved on.  The first room they put me in had noworking telephone, either in the room or the bsthroom, no working hairdryer, no working alarm or bedside lamp. When I took a shower half the bedroom was flooded, as the seals between the glass and bath edge was missing. I actually stubbed my toe on floorplanks that were lifting from previous flooding. They the moved me across the passage into a room with such a chemical smell that I started suffocating as my throat and chest started closing up. That was when I phoned the Sheraton Four Point around the corner and moved there.

Very good hotel with good value for money,"the hotel is nice, sea front, the area is a little bit crowded as it is near some buildings that are under construction, it is a little bit far from the center of Victoria Island. the rooms are clean and spacious with good air condition. the internet is very fast. the breakfast is good with variety of food and egg station. the staff are friendly and there is a drop off service to the airport and other places.  unfortunately the last 2 days, we faced some unpleasant things. the first thing is the power cut off, the power cut about 20 to 30 times and of course when it took so long to come back the internet goes also. the second thing is the tap water, i opened the tap of the shower to take a bath but unfortunately i found the water was in brown color. but this did happen in the",March 2014,,,wrote a review Mar 2014,"Cairo, Egypt","['48 contributions', '21 helpful votes']",40,[]
Please stick to what you do best,"Disappointing is putting what happened on February 14, 2014 mildly! They ran a Promo for a Valentine's Day buffet which they clearly could not handle. As early as 8.30pm they did not have any more food; it was so bad their 'chef' was scrapping crumbs/leftovers from the trays and serving. Please, for goodness sakes it is a buffet not a secondary school dining hall. The hotel refused to give several couples a refund. We also did not get the room we asked for, but we let that pass, our night was already ruined. The smell that enveloped the Hotel was something else; we managed to sleep and were out by first light. Complaining at the front desk was another mistake on the morning of the 15th. The attendant was rude to say the least.

"Disappointed expectation, but good staff.","My family and I spent the valentine's night there, we had read other reviews on trip advisor, so our expectation was kind of high. The staff were friendly and professional. We had paid for a deluxe room with lagoon view, but am positive we dnt get that instead we go a swimming pool view instead! I asked a staff and she said this was the lagoon view. Totally different from d picture. The rooms need proper maintenance the paint on the wall were peeling off and the bathroom tiles needed more white seal. The towels and robe look worn out. I have to say the small chop we had was lovely (besides the tasteless springrolls). Then the TV dnt have as many channels.the hotel is in a nice location.

So so Bad,Attended a program here and was I disappointed. They were so concerned about the expatriates and let a lot to be desired for others.  The main gate was open for Whites to pass through while I was told to go through the pedestrian gate. The Air conditioners went off and on. The Hall was small and the fire exit was blocked with chairs. to crown it all water did not flow always and you were left with a bucket of water to serve you cleaning needs.  Tea/coffee breaks were guided and you were told what to and what not to take with outrageously small canapés. Food was never enough in the afternoons and you were ordered to eat what was left.

Enjoyable Stay,I stayed at the Hotel Bon Voyage on a recent visit to Lagos and was pleasantly surprised. I had moved from some disasterous accommodation after 1 night and the Bon Voyage was very comfortable. The very friendly staff upgraded my room to an ocean view and were helpful and courteous throughout my 3 week stay. The food is good and the location is convenient - right in the middle of Victoria Island close to bars and restaurants.

Great hotel with even greater staff,"My NGO/non-profit organization hosted a 15-person meeting here.  The hotel was identified for its quality and positive reviews and selected for the reasonable prices we were quoted and the responsiveness of management during the process.  Very comfortable, beautiful hotel on Victoria Island.  Clean, comfortable rooms, fully-equipped conference facilities, excellent restaurant with complementary buffet breakfast, buffet lunches and dinners, as well as a la carte entrees.  Beautiful ocean-side pool and pool bar (with food service) that are both open late: perfect for relaxing after long days.  Excellent hotel for business and some additional relaxation.

Excellent Hotel Experience In Lagos!!,"I stayed in this hotel on business. It was referred to me by another business associate who previously stayed there. To be honest, this hotel surpassed my expectations as a business traveler. Upon my arrival in Lagos, I was promptly retrieved from the airport even after being delayed well over an hour because my luggage wasn't available on the carousel. When I exited the airport, the hotel representative was standing there front and center. During my stay at the hotel, I was always greeted with the highest level of hospitality. Not one staff member passed by me without greeting me with welcoming words and a warm Nigerian smile. ...and the food was EXCELLENT!!!

An average stay at an upmarket hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for good 15 days , rooms were pretty neat and with basic amenities . Service was at acceptable levels , However nothing great about the service . There were house keeping issues like water overflowed from floor above into my room because of which i had to change my room which was done pretty quickly . Morning breakfast was with good spread however vegetarians like me will have to be contempt with whatever fruits and breads available , mashed potatoes all time favorite for the chef here .  Fairly safe place to stay with good security especially when u r travelling to Nigeria , view from the pool side is good however sea water is clogged up with garbage .
