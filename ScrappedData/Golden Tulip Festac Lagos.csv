RAT,We saw the golden tulip apartments festac on trip advisor and decided to give it a try being that we were traveling with kids and preferred to stay in an apartment! Everything was going averagely then a humongous RAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Showed up !!!!

The Worst!,"First of all, it is no longer the Golden Tulip but rather the Festival Hotel as it has been sold. They didn't bother to tell anybody and you can still book through the Golden Tulip site. The place is dilapidated, aircon is down in entire hotel, service is poor, rooms are small, credit card machines don't work. Breakfast had a nice selection but food not fresh. Not worth the price at all. Worst hotel in Lagos!",February 2020,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2020,"Columbia, Maryland","['41 contributions', '15 helpful votes']",10,[]
Disappointing Stay,"It was a most frustrating stay at this hotel. Got in around midday. My first encounter with how inefficient the front desk was. Had made a prior book via Hotel.com and paid for a room for US$ 68, 00 for one night. I came with a group who were booked on the 4th floor and therefore asked for a room on this floor. was tole I had to pay an additional Naira 21,824.70 = US$ 24, which adds up to US$ 92! When asked why was told because of the floor and I wanted to be with the group! The hotel is huge and most of the rooms were empty! No amount of reasoning helped. No explanation given! Got to the floor, it had a dank smell which the best of air fresheners could not conceal! The air conditioning was on but the room was hot! Made a complaint as did many others on the floor, were told it",September 2019,,Hotel is surrounded by high rise buildings of the hotel rooms.,wrote a review Oct 2019,Austria,"['75 contributions', '49 helpful votes']",20,"['Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_20', 'Sleep Quality bubble_10']"
NICE LOCATION,"Golden Tulip, Festac Town is located at Amuwo Odofin, Mile 2 Estate.  The hotel share the same premises with Festival Mall otherwise known as Shopprites. The hotel was formerly known as Dubar Hotel with nice structures and good parking lots.   Check - in at the hotel was poor and the front desk still needs constant training and  retraining.

One of the worst hotels ever,"I stayed for two night for a business trip. When I arrived they gave a room that the door was broken (it couldn‚Äôt close the door). The gave another room that it seemed that some slept before. I couldn‚Äôt pay when I made the check in. I other dinner to the room, the waiter very strange gay that called me to the room at 4AM. Unacceptable.  There wasn‚Äôt a safe box to keep my passport safe. I tried to pay 5th times but there was always a problem (they told it was my credit card, wasn‚Äôt true) I made a transfer because they told me that we the receipt from the bank would be enough it wasn‚Äôt true either.

Just Fair,The check in was good. Very friendly lady at the desk. The room needs to be upgraded. The furniture is outdated. The rug was dirty though swept clean. The bathroom has a bath tub. It was clean. The television set need to be changed. It was very far from a flat screen. The location of the hotel is another challenge. The long hours spent on the road is a big disappointment. The hotel have a swimming pool (i did not use it). The food at breakfast was okay. Though choices were few. There is a gym and a room for massage.,September 2018,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Oct 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria","['45 contributions', '12 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Rooms bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30']"

"Chose for long stay, bitterly disappointed","Check-in - Smooth, efficient. Required payment up-front, but that was o.k. as we chose to pay daily rather than for the entire planned 11 days. Room - Very poor quality furnishings, fixtures and fittings. Everything falling apart in the rooms - yes rooms!!, as we requested to be moved from a carpeted to a tiled room - guess what, the tiled room was more expensive!! And even though we were told the new room had been specially cleaned and provisioned for us, it was no better than the room we had moved from. Fridge, closet, tiles all in poor state of repair and actually falling apart. Big sign declared all guests to use safe for valuables... safe in our room did not work and it took 3 days for it to be fixed!!. Hallways stank and had heavily stained, carpets that were lifting in",April 2018,,,wrote a review May 2018,"Surrey, Canada","['8 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",20,[]

A Little Disappointed,My family and I stayed over 10 nights at this hotel and did not have air conditioning for 8 of the nights.  The hotel provided us with a huge industrial fan instead that was very loud.  The room that we were placed in was very hard to get wifi connection. The hotel took 4 days to remedy that issue with the internet.  The buffet breakfast is included for one person and it provides a variety of foods for breakfast.  The yellow taxi or KKs are not allowed to drop you off or pick you up directly in front of the hotel due to theft issues and car break-ins.  It was nice that the mall is located nearby and gives more options for food.  The hotel food was way overpriced.  Room service takes over an hour to respond to any request.

Crowded Out,"The decision to site the Festac Festival Mall in the same compound with this hotel is a disaster. There is no demarcation between the hotel  and  mall area so one is always ""exposed"" to a crowd. Expect strangers to approach your car at night to seek alms .  This also makes for long car queues whenever one is going in or out of the hotel as both facilities share a common gate.   As for hotel service, the food is good and delivered promptly via room service. However, it is an unpleasant experience to meet your food tray still not cleared from the passage hours after lunch.

On the verge of perfection- It has all you need,"This is a non-smoking hotel The rooms are big and spacious. The hotel shares a compound with a mall and  two other restaurants giving you lots of options without leaving the hotel compound The compound has ample paid parking, but you get a waiver if you lodge in the hotel It was quiet while I was there  The toilets  were super clean and quite modern  Adequate and fast elevators Room decor is good but the carpet and sheets look worn out.  We had a fridge,  kettle for hot water , TV, Desk and Chair The air seemed slightly stale, however it the air quality is fair.

Restaurant.,6 of us popped in for a quick lunch. 2 hours before the final meal was served. Only 3 meals were hot food and 3 were salads! We were the only people in the restaurant.  Not to be recommended. Unless you want to wait 2 hours for a simple snack.

"Very run down, dirty & smelly","I came here for 3 nights on a business trip. My room was on the 6th floor, and the smell as you leave the elevators is strong and unpleasant.  The whole place smells one way or another, and it's generally run down, dirty and shabby. I travel frequently in sub-Saharan Africa, and this place is well below standard.  The safe in my room was locked, and couldn't be opened - despite asking for 3 days.  I didn't fancy eating in the hotel and was lucky enough to find a restaurant called Rhapsody, on the opposite side of the parking lot.

Air conditioning felt great coming  in from outside, which was a huge relief coming from a girl who lives in a cold region of the United States.  I loved the huge tub! I could soak there for  hours!
