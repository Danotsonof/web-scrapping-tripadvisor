Back 9 years later and still impressed with The Wheatbaker,"Returned 9 yrs later with our son and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised that the hotel property is still as good as we remembered from our first visit. The staff was attentive, the buffet breakfast and lunches did not disappoint, and as always the art showcased throughout the hotel was divine. This time around we used the pool and spa which were both excellent.  If you want to have a hotel that provides a quiet, calm, respite from the Lagos swirl this place is it. You will leave feeling relaxed and refreshed.",June 2023,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Jul 2023,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","['390 contributions', '137 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"

Great business hotel or good for a short stay,"The hotel is not conveniently situated but it is a fairly quiet hotel. WIFI was a bit slow, needed a technician to assist to get it working as well.

Don’t stay here,THIS HOTEL IS NOT A FIVE STAR! DO NOT STAY HERE!  The noise levels are UNACCEPTABLE. The hotel is old and musty. The food is terrible and the staff are mostly rude. There walls between the rooms are so thin. You can hear your neighbours conversations and the moving of chairs and other furniture peices by those above. You also get charged for a cappuccino at breakfast as it’s not considered part of the breakfast. I was very disappointed with this hotel. It looks nothing like the photoshopped images they present. It’s really not worth anything near the price they charge.

The best business hotel in Lagos,Very nice hotel. Well situated and in a quiet neighborhood. Staff were very courteous and the restaurant and bar served good food. Clearly the hotel favored by the Lagos business traveler in the know. Get a higher floor room facing the pool would be my only advice. And turn off your a/c.

Unbeatable Service,"This is my first stay at the Wheatbaker, and I can now understand why my friends stay here when in town. Although the hotel is on the small side and is a little dated, the service was exceptional. Every single member of staff from the guards to management displayed warmth, care and courtesy, the likes of which I have not experienced in any hotel I have stayed in Nigeria. What makes it even more remarkable is that it seems really genuine and not forced and I could imagine a long term stay here. The food and cocktails were also great.

Great hotel but theft ruined our overall experience,"I stayed at the Wheatbaker for 3 weeks in August this year with my son, mainly for a business trip.  Positives   - polite and attentive staff - great, well-maintained decor and superb facilities overall - fantastic gym - good covid-compliant hygiene/other covid-related measures - delicious food - great onsite gym - wonderful poolside setting for business meetings - a well-managed business centre - very comfortable bedroom  Negatives - Problems with wifi on one crucial evening when I was due to dial onto a board meeting online.

Bespoke Customer Experience at its Best,"I made myself a promise to be back at this hotel since my visit last November. And this time, I was able to witness a hotel all out to beat its own standards...The WheatBaker Hotel.  My visit to the hotel last year was for a business engagement. But this time around, it was my wedding anniversary and my wife couldn't agree more with my choice of getaway location. I supposed this is based on the positive feedbacks I came back with from the hotel during my last visit.  Of course, we got the same impeccable services as I did the last time out. There was, however, a twist to it this time. When I called WheatBaker a week out to our check-in time, little could I imagine what would be in store for me and my wife.

Maintaining a standard in Lagos,"I stayed at the Wheatbaker for a week after a number of years away. I can’t fault the way standards are maintained even as we come out of the pandemic and as business travel changes. The staff are almost all the same staff who welcomed me nearly 10 years ago when I first set foot in the place...this familiarity is something rare. Very friendly team right up to the management team with Simon and Gerald always visible around the hotel. Service is excellent. Room service and restaurant excellent.

Good service,"A good business hotel with very good service. The breakfast is quite a spread. Their service staff are very good. Dinner is between 2 restaurants: one with a buffet and limited a la carte menu; and the other completely a la carte. I ate at the first restaurant for both dinners, first time the buffet, which was underwhelming. The second night, I ordered a pizza which was very bad. The topping was completely separate from the raw base.

Oasis,We stayed at this hotel on our recent stay to visit our son who is working in Lagos at present. A large part of the enjoyment we experienced was down to the welcome and comfort offered by The Wheatbaker.  The managers had already been helpful before our arrival (we had some glitches securing a visa) but were visible and friendly whilst we were there. Both Simon and Gerard were most kind to us and allowed us to use our room to accommodate our late return flight.

Management will go out of the way to accommodate your requests even down to the senior chef coming out of the kitchen to take special dessert requests - fried apples in brown sugar and vanilla ice!

Not up to standard! Extremely expensive without the value.,Poor maintained rooms that could do with updating and deep cleaning. Stained floors and toilet seat. No dental kit or iron & ironing board. Discolored towels. Food was of poor quality and poor variety - buffet was N10500 and you still had to pay for drinks - I guess that's why it was empty most of the time. Most of the food contained chilies - which made it impossible to eat.,February 2018,,,wrote a review Feb 2018,,"['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",20,[]

"If you just have to have a boutique hotel and don't care what you spend, here you go","This is usually the most expensive room rate in all of Lagos, and apparently there's enough of a demand that it can keep it up. Personally I don't know why people would spend more on a room here than at the Intercontinental. My room was fine, the bed was comfortable, but I've stayed at a lot of places in Lagos and there's wasn't a big difference here. There's just not anything special about this place; at least, not $400+ per night special. If you've got to be in Ikoyi and don't want to stay at the Southern Sun, and again, if price is not at all a concern, then you'll probably have a perfectly enjoyable stay here.

The first time my husband and I were at The Wheatbaker,  we were pleasantly surprised and excited when the hotel management upgraded our room! The room, amenities and service were so excellent that it made me want to go back. This time I wanted something memorable for my husband and I for our wedding anniversary on the 31st of December and decided The Wheatbaker was still the best hotel to stay (even though I received an offer of two nights stay for one free night from a similar hotel!). We were again pleasantly surprised when we received an anniversary surprise  from the Wheatbaker Team (A bottle of champagne: Moet and Chandon on ice, fresh fruits",December 2016,,,wrote a review Jan 2017,,['2 contributions'],50,[]
You WILL become fat here.,"I have never stayed here(I live in Nigeria so it's ok) but I have eaten here. I'm also from Nigeria, but the only Nigerian foods I like are rice and stew, pounded yam and Suya. And I'm not fond of most Western foods either.

"Supposed to be tops, but..........","Had dinner with a friend at the Grill on a recent visit to Lagos, who told me that it was the best in Lagos. May be the ambiance was nice, but it was disappointing in so many way. To start with, there were no napkins at any of the table, which was quite surprising for a restaurant of that level. Actually, it seemed that no one eating had any napkins as I observed. We asked for napkins at the waiter was go around tables to come up with two, and it was somewhat difficult!! I ordered the lamb chops at the recommendation of the waiter. They were way under cooked (ordered medium to well done) and salty that I could not eat more than a couple of bites.

We both had a starter and then steaks. Our fillet was closer to rare but was still delish. Wine reasonably priced compared to other restaurants in Lagos.

Sundowners with some light jazz and vocals,"We were one of three couples that decided rather impromptu to take a trip to The Wheatbaker for sundowners on Friday evening. We were not looking for anything extraordinary, a beer or two and some wine with perhaps some snacks. The area by the pool has an intimacy about it which as the evening progresses develops a relaxed ambience. The jazz music was superb with the chap on the sax absolutely hitting it perfectly. The vocals that joined in later were superb and the young man's range was quite incredible. It was an absolute pleasure to sit by the pool with friends and soak up the atmosphere.

Best hotel in Lagos,Have stayed here a few times now & have visited a number other hotels over the last 10 years. Can honestly say this is Nigeria's best hotel.  Rooms are a decent size & bathroom has both a full walk-in shower plus a superset bath.  The room has all the amenities required including its own Nespresso coffee machine.  Internet is pretty good by African standards.  The location is good if you want to be in Ikoyi but you will experience some traffic if you want to business in VI. Nonetheless The Wheatbaker is well located and worth the stay.  Room prices are on the heavy side so expect to pay $300-500 per night. If you want something similar but cheaper suggest that you look at Raddison Blu in VI.,August 2016,,,wrote a review Aug 2016,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['12 contributions', '12 helpful votes']",50,[]

Modern luxury in the Heart of Lagos; International Standards,"I booked this hotel for a romantic night with my partner. I had e-mailed the hotel to explain the occasion, which they took on board. Evidence of this was the lovely card and bottle of champagne awaiting us in the room, a very pleasant surprise indeed. The room itself, the Executive King Room was sparkling, well-furnished and comfortable with a view over the pool. I must single out Ms Henrietta Omogbai, the reservation manager for whom nothing was too much through out the booking process. My sole recommendation would be for staff at the restaurant to wear smiley faces. This was noticed while we were having breakfast on Sunday morning so it could have been due to Sunday morning blues!

"Great rooms, helpful staff","Stayed a week at the Wheatbaker for a work trip in June, 2016. My room was a real oasis in Lagos: large, luxurious and spotless. It was a real pleasure to spend time there. I'm told the hotel opened five years ago, but the rooms still look and feel new.  The hotel has a boutique feel, and the dining and social spaces are small compared to grander places. Still, the service was excellent.  I'd rate the food at the restaurants and via room service as good but not great. I found some dishes I liked, especially the grilled seafood, but others I thought were poorly executed -- too much gloopy sauce on some salads, for instance.  Overall, I liked the Wheatbaker quite a lot.

One of the best hotels in the world,I have stayed in many hotels world wide and the Wheatbaker is right up there with the best of the best.  Incredible service. Fantastic food. Great ambiance.  Cannot believe this hotel is in Lagos - when inside you may well imagine that you are at one of the best in Europe or the USA.

Lovely stay!,"It was a great time as the first night was more than exceptional. The lounge is just so enough to do the magical work as the couches are more than comfortable.  The restaurant is not something to talk about as the aroma of thefood from the kitchen (whilst waiting) will nearly makes you take out your last dinefrom your pocket. The wi fi is a network that is constantly ready to hook u up with your friends and family back home as it is mre than ""strong "".

Service levels are absolutely unique in Lagos, food quality is outstanding, and all infrastructure, furniture etc. is perfectly maintained. The Wheatbaker consistently manages to deliver at high quality, i.e. it is a guarantee for a great experience. To be fair, this quality also comes at a high price.

The Definitive Place to Stay in Lagos,"Stayed recently for 3 nights for the first time. Located in the residential heart of Ikoyi, this South African boutique hotel provides the corporate traveler all the comfort, convenience and service expectations of a luxury boutique hotel.   Our local management booked us to stay at the Wheatbaker due to issues with Intercontinental where we stayed on previous occasions. After staying for a few days, it is hard for me to fault the Wheatbaker. I was impressed by the excellent service from the staff. Rooms were well furnished and the breakfast at Deli Restaurant was pretty good. Room service menu was great too.   In a nutshell, a wonderful hotel run by experienced professionals that understands what it takes to be rated the best hotel in Lagos.

Elemis facial products have their impact but in their expert hands another five years is shed.   Their firm hot stone massages get rid of all the kinks from running, cycling and simply getting old!

Performance ok - Price not,"As very frequent business traveller I have a very sense to judge for the price / performance ratio of a hotel. First impression (check-in, room appearance) was positive but at night my room was not suitable for a good sleep - by far to noisy due to running power generators at the hotel (permanent shortage of general power supply). You better ask a room facing the pool and not the other side of the corridor. I needed to move after my first night, cos noise level of the diesel generators did not allow me to fall asleep. Second night was better after changing to the other side of the corridor (tough negotiations). BUT - 440 USD for one night was not worth it.

Free wifi with good speed was a nice touch, too often good hotels charge for this, but this is how it should be.  Cleaners and turn down teams were very professional.  Shower was great, good pressure and plenty of hot water, plus very nice soft towels.  Breakfast was very good quality and all staff were professional and friendly.

Nice place for quiet high quality dinner,Two of us went early one evening for dinner. It's good for couples or quiet business discussions and the food and service was international standard.   The wheatbaker is a boutique hotel in Ikoyi close to Banana Island so it's in the most upmarket part of the town and the door reflects all that. Prices are pretty high too but not unreasonable compared to similar quality in London.   The hotel room rates are at the high end even for Lagos. I've not stayed there but people say it's the best in the city.

When everyone gets back to the hotel in the evenings and they settle with their guests to have a drink in the communal areas, the ""boutiqueness"" of the hotel shows a weakness as it becomes overcrowded in the limited communal space that is available and is almost uncomfortable.

Def best hotel in Lagos,I've had some pretty bad hotel experiences in Lagos. Wheatbaker is the exception.  The rooms are clean and comfortable - being fairly new the decor is up to date and the place is fresh.   Service was the best I've had from anyone in Nigeria. As far as being able to offer tourist info they could sharpen up.  It's situated out the mayhem of this bustling city so you can get some peaceful rest.  The cost is worth it if you care about the environment you stay in.,June 2014,,,wrote a review Jan 2015,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['33 contributions', '16 helpful votes']",40,[]
Relaxing haven in a busy city,"I really enjoyed my stay at The Wheatbaker. The staff were very polite and courteous and the food was good. My room was lovely but the minibar is locked unless you ask for a key, which I find strange!   I do believe that it's exceptionally expensive but then, hotels in Lagos generally are and to have a haven to go 'home' to and relax is worth paying for. Also, the airport transfer with personal touches is a very welcome service for the weary traveller.  The only thing I would say is that occasionally the service can be a tad overbearing. There's a fine line between great service and a bit 'too much'. For example, I left my room for less than 20 minutes to see a colleague in the lobby and upon getting back to my room I find that my half-drunk coca-cola had been cleared away.

Best hotel in Lagos,"I can strongly recommend the team at the Wheatbaker for an all round top performance. Best Hotel in Lagos is a title well earned. I have tried a few of the good hotels but The Wheatbaker stands out, staff who remember you, excellent food, clean rooms, good amenities, good security. I have stayed a number of times and have deliberately not reviewed the hotel until now to have a more holistic view based on half a dozen stays. The only downside, others already know it's the best hotel in Lagos so you need to book early to avoid disappointment!

First Class in every single way,"I have made it a habit to lounge or dine at the Wheatbaker at least once every fortnight ever since it opened. Over the countless visits, I have never had a bad experience.   The hotel has raised the bar of service so high that I sometimes forget I'm in a third-world country during each visit. Security is professional and courteous, without discreet pestering for a tip as is common in most venues in Lagos. On walking in, I am always entranced by the fresh scent, reliable air conditioning, mellow lighting and vibrant art. More than two years later, everything from the restrooms to the sofas still looks spotless and inviting.

Best boutique hotel in Africa,"Let's explain this simply: when it comes to hotels, there are 3 scenarios that play out: fantastic finishes and terrible servce/great service in not so great atmosphere/ or plain rubbish.

Definitely the best Hotel in Lagos,"I stayed at Wheatbaker early May... As those who have been to Lagos will know the hotels are extremely over-priced for what they are.

I stayed at Southern Sun which was ok but very basic accommodation in my humble opinion. Then I moved to wheatbaker on my way back and stayed at wheatbaker and was very pleasantly surprised.  The room was lovely. The toilet and shower and plumbing and finishing (which tends to be the let down in most properties in Nigeria) were excellent  and honestly world class.

The service was very good; however, I attribute that more to the waiters' recognition of my travel companion, rather than just good service, since I saw others vying unsucessfully for their attention.   The atmosphere was noisy and a bit crowded. When full, and it appeared the type of locale that was ALWAYS full, it was a bit uncomfortable manipulating the buffet without hitting patrons' tables.

Great hotel and good service,"I have just stayed in the Wheatbaker on my second visit to Lagos and you would be hard pressed to beat the excellent level of service offered. The hotel itself is very comfortable and the rooms are well designed and equipped, although mine was slightly noisy. The food is good and the staff can not do enough to help you. What is particularly nice is the presence of the managers, even at 7am on Saturday, who are on hand to talk to the guests and to smooth out any slight issues that may occur. If you are visiting Lagos this is definitely the place to stay and I will look forward to returning if or when I am next in Lagos.",November 2013,,,wrote a review Nov 2013,Blandford,"['62 contributions', '34 helpful votes']",50,[]
Good boutique hotel,"I have every reason to believe that this is a (the?) top hotel in Lagos, especially if you were to conduct business in Ikoyii. By international standards, it is a good 4-star hotel (although it is priced as a 5-star.) The rooms are clean, and the furnishings are good, but this is not Four Seasons/Mandarin O/St Regis stuff by any stretch of imagination. On service, people are extremely friendly and try very hard to please, although there are lapses (clueless receptionists, questionable timing on laundry as it is outsourced, etc.) The common areas (bar, lobby) are too small, so at peak hours, it cam be hard to find a place to sit.",November 2013,,,wrote a review Nov 2013,"Singapore, Singapore","['5276 contributions', '1622 helpful votes']",40,[]

As good as it gets in Lagos,"This hotel is as good as it gets in Lagos.  The service is extremely good for Nigeria. The rooms are modern and comfortable, they even have nespresso machines.

Second time not so lucky!,"Stayed before, shortly after it opened and was impressed, returned last week and standards have dropped. Please let me expand, as I know the GM reviews TA - check in fast which was great, shown to the room G04 and immediately upon entering it was evident that the room smelt musty and put this down to the aircon system. Complained straight away to be told that the hotel was full and couldnt move rooms, although I doubted this as never saw many people in restaurant, bar, lobbies or at breakfast during my 2 day stay. It was only after I left and filled out the feedback form did I get an email advising that they would investigate and look to resolve. Shame this couldn't have been done the next morning.

Good business hotel,"Great with security and wonderfully friendly with staff that seem genuinely warm and engaging. Wifi throughout though turning the login process to a SSID type as opposed to a web login would prevent continuous retries during a visit to the hotel. Food very good. Design and interior of the facilities very good. Slight roundabout route between rooms and fitness centre. Slight let down in cleanliness of rooms (bed cover dirty underneath and dusty corners). Overall though my favorite hotel in Lagos, having moved from using the previously excellent Southern Sun (very poor service levels today).  Have not tried new InterContinental yet.

Verdict: don’t stay anywhere else.,"I had been to Lagos once before, but had been unhappy with my accommodation.  This time around, various clients I was visiting unanimously recommended the Wheatbaker, so I went ahead and booked without doing further research.  When I checked in, it became instantly clear why everyone had pointed me towards this hotel.  It is not only easily the best hotel in Lagos, but the Wheatbaker delivered some of the best value for money I have received at any hotel, anywhere, in eight years of frequent business travel.  There is no doubt that Lagos can be a tricky city to navigate, but this is easily forgotten on the hotel premises.  Everything works (wifi, 24h roomservice, pool, gym, forex), staff is friendly and attentive, requests are met quickly.

The conference facilities which I have also had occasion to experience are also well served.

Even though a touch of rain had threatened the night it soon passed. The chicken liver pate was divine but i'm not sure serving of sweetened wafer biscuits to accompany is the most sensible choice. Still its very nice to see the pate served with that layer of butter on top. Very old school but i like that. The drinks are priced high but we had no quibble due to the great service provided.

The best hotel in Nigeria. Period.,"If I had to sum it up in one sentence, then it would be very simple - this is the best hotel I've ever been to in Nigeria. Period.  And I stayed in many different hotels, usually favouring the Protea chain, simply because there was nothing better available. Until now.

Peaceful's night sleep at The Wheatbaker,"Previous reviews spot on - I particularly liked the fact that the location is in a semi residential area so very quiet location. Staff were excellent in all areas, gym well equipped and rooms very comfortable. Being a coffee addict, the nespresso machine was a welcome start whilst getting ready in the mornings. Breakfast offered everything required and room service club sandwich, one of the best ive had. Burgers in the bar pretty decent as well. Costs, well Lagos isnt a cheap place to do business but ive paid more and paid less in West Africa previously. Hotel was busy so clearly not putting people off. Unfortunately they had a drain problem on my last morning but there was a lot of banging going on so sounded like they were taking immediate action to sort the problem.

"Well designed, safe, and well serviced.  GREAT breakfast.","My husband and I traveled to Lagos on business.  As you will no doubt find, hotels in Lagos are not cheap.  However, the Wheatbaker was - at this time - offering a promotion, which made their daily evening rates 30USD cheaper than other hotels of the same calibre.   Rooms were well appointed, clean and provided all the amenities you would expect for a top level hotel.  While the power did go on and off several times, the generators were able to kick start the power efficiently.  Bed was comfortable, the breakfast spread was completely beyond expectations, and the service was excellent.  Upon checkout, management discovered that they overcharged me by 30USD, and refunded it immediately.

Highly recommended!,"I stayed at the Wheatbaker for over two weeks and I plan to stay there again next time I am in Lagos. I really enjoyed my stay because the security was very good, all the staff were very professional and the hotel itself was impeccable. Best of all, the bed was so comfortable. Even the sheets felt good. It was wonderful to be able to sleep so well in a bed other than at home.And it was quite and peaceful. No loud generators. The water was clean and clear (if you know Lagos, you'll know why I mention that). Everything was perfect.

What a truly pleasant surprise The Weatbaker is!,"I have spent many, many years in Nigeria and eight months out of the year I actually live in Apapa (where my office is located) eight months out of the year.  On the weekends all my social events are in the VI area and, not wanting to make the precarious trip back to Apapa in the wee hours of the morning, I prefer to stay at hotels during those times.  Consequently, I have stayed in many places from small boutique-style hotels to larger properties in and around Lagos but have never been satisfied with any of these places.

The best hotel in Lagos and unquestionably Nigeria,"Where do you start describing this hotel....having been a fan of the Radisson BLU for a long time, the Wheatbaker is a real jewel in the crown in Lagos, if not Nigeria. In all the hotels I have stayed in Nigeria, I have never met nor seen the senior management so visible. The guys were constantly doing the rounds, checking if meals or drinks were ok, checking on you as an individual as well.  Also, I had a colleague who needed and extended stay and recption could not guarantee the room, however, I mentioned this to Simon (the GM) and within 20 minutes it was resolved and a room guaranteed - excellent & exceptional personal service.

So here we were at this restaurant, expecting the usual letdown one would find at almost all Nigerian outfits with such hype. Well, let's say...they blew us away, quite literally! So, if you're looking for a swanky place with the right ambience and surprisingly good food, try this hotel's restaurant. The staff are quite polite and fawning, too.

Check-in was seamless and couldnt but notice the sense of urgency amongst all the staff and managers alike. Room service often time the achilles of most hotels around the world was breezy.

Pleasant and Beautiful,"First of all, checking in was a breeze, I doubt I stayed at the counter for up to 15 minutes. I stayed at Wheatbaker Hotel for a few nights and lord, did the staff make a fuss over me. At some point I felt terribly embarrassed but I know they were only doing their job and they did it very well. The ambiance is next to none in Lagos, I believe it is in a class of its own. It isn't noisy, busy and is just perfect if what you need is a get-away after the hustle and bustle of Lagos. It is quite pricey however, I haven't come to the conclusion as to whether the cost was worth the experience but if you can afford it then I guess it is worth it.

The rooms are well laid out, the gym well equipped, variety of places to sit and have a drink as well as fairly good food.  I was on a busines workshop and I must say that we were overfeed.

Quiet Retreat,Probably the most important aspect in choosing a hotel in Lagos is location as anyone who has been to Nigeria can attest to traffic can easily ruin your entire trip. The Wheatbaker benefits from a great location tucked away in a quiet corner of fancy Ikoyi which pretty much guarantees your stay will not be disrupted by heavy traffic and incessant noise. It is also quite a central location and allows for easy access to both Victoria Island/Lekki and Ikeja. The staff are very helpful in indicating rush hour times so you can sail against traffic at all times and plan meetings accordingly. The great business center and meeting rooms are another alternative to avoiding traffic altogether!  The rooms are plush and elegantly designed and are larger than your average hotel rooms.
