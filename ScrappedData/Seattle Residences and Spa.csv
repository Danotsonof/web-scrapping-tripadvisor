Clayhall by SRS overnight stay,The apartment is what it is meant to be however details need to be checked to ensure the experience doesn’t come up short.   The breakfast had one issue that could not be overlooked - the butter was kept on a plate of warm food and had melted by the time it got to the apartment. It should be kept separately in a small ice tray.   The DSTV service was also patchy.   Overall a space that can be lived in without much effort and is very comfortable  I enjoyed the fact that you felt cocooned within the apartment. Can even be used as a staycation.,August 2021,Traveled solo,The location sometimes has peak times traffic so plan your journeys to avoid peak hours.,wrote a review Aug 2021,Lagos,"['22 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",40,[]
Great place to eat Especially at this time,"I have been working from home since March last year and shunned the possibility of any face to face business meeting or eating outdoor. However, I had one planned face to face that was a ""must do"". I had to search for a place I considered safe and where they played by the safety book. Seatle Residence met my bar of safety which is pretty high. I eventually had my custom made lunch(not on the menu list) at their restaurant and it was great!",February 2021,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2021,"Lagos, Nigeria","['97 contributions', '31 helpful votes']",50,[]
5 star resort,"First time in Lagos and this place has surpassed my expectations. The staff is excellently trained and attended to all of our needs.

Island Gem,"I stayed for a week in January and even during their soft opening phase, the service was great, friendly staff and the perfect place to kick off shoes after a hectic day. The spa is an excellent attraction as well. The home-away-home feel with its bespoke services makes it the perfect place for those who like the boutique concept. I will definitely go back again.",January 2019,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2019,"Banjul, Gambia","['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,"['Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
Great experience - top notch flat right in the center of Lagos,"Stayed for a few days earlier this month (February 2019), I went with a couple of friends for a Nigerian friends wedding and we were all very impressed with the facility.  It's modeled after a hotel so offers you the same kind of service you'd get in a 4 or 5 star hotel.  According to my Nigerian friend (the bride) it's hands down better than a lot of the hotels in Lagos.  What makes it a stand out experience is that you aren't boxed in a room instead you have a spacious 3 bedroom flat.  Huge grounds, swimming pool and gym.  There was a restaurant and if you decide not to go down to eat you can order room service.  A small and cosy spa as well as business facilities which I needed for some unexpected printing for work.  The staff were extremely helpful recommending alternative",February 2019,Traveled with friends,We saw the penthouse which is much grander than the 3 bedroom suite,wrote a review Feb 2019,,['1 contribution'],40,"['Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Perfect accommodation + Gorgeous Views,"I stayed at the Seattle residences with a couple of friends and it was such a great experience. From the service to the comfort of the penthouse to the gorgeous views, we were so impressed with the accommodation. We had massages and the massage was by far the best massage I’ve had in the world. Not only did the therapists pay attention to my stress points, they also used different techniques during the massage. I highly recommend Seattle residences.",February 2019,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Feb 2019,,"['3 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]

Best Luxury Accomodation in Lagos,"Seattle residences is hands down one of the most beautiful and well positioned residences in Lagos, along the five cowrie creek.
