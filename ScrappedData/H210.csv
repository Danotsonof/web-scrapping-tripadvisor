Really good hotel,"I stayed here over Christmas and had a really good experience. The rooms were cleaned daily, the staff were really friendly and the facilities listed (lift, soundproof rooms etc) were accurate.  The only thing I didn't like was that on arrival, the door of my bathroom was faulty and wouldn't close and they thought it was okay since I wasn't sharing the room with anyone else. There weren't any immediate plans to fix it either. I told them it was not okay and they offered me another room which I took.  The staff are very responsive to requests so I was  quite happy staying there. It was an overall pleasant experience.",December 2019,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Jan 2020,Brierley Hill,"['5 contributions', '20 helpful votes']",40,[]
"Professional, clean and Secure","I live in Texas and I traveled to Lagos in March of 2019 this month and I tell you this hotel was so beautiful and such a great experience. All the staff was so kind, respectful and professional. Mary the front desk receptionist was always willing to help and accommodate us regarding anything we needed. We had a issue in our room with the ac and Mary was able to send us help and they got right on it and had no problem with moving us to another room. The food was delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and the hotel is locate din a great location. As an american I felt secure comfortable and I made the right choice.l will stay here again and recommend this hotel.",March 2019,Traveled solo,The rooms with the bathtub may be smaller than the rooms with just a shower,wrote a review Mar 2019,"Ikoyi, Nigeria",['2 contributions'],40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Upgrade,"H210 has an excellent location on a quiet side street, just a block away from major thoroughfare Ajose Adeogun St. It shares its grounds with Caravel Suites, located in the building at the back. Apparently, the owners of the 2 establishments are good friends.  My reservation was for a Gold Suite, the cheapest room type, but I think I received an upgrade. In any case, I was pleasantly surprised by the photogenic, elegant & classy suite. The extremely comfortable bed ensured a great night's sleep. The efficient A/C unit kept the room nice & cool. There was plenty of closet space. The electrical sockets are all UK style. Adapters are available on request.  Breakfast was included in my room rate. The breakfast buffet only offered African favorites. The staff was happy to suggest",May 2018,Traveled solo,,wrote a review May 2018,"Ghent, Belgium","['1434 contributions', '84 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50']"
Decent hotel at Muri Okunola Street in Victoria Island,I spent a night at H210 Hotel in Victoria Island. The staff were enthusiastic and absolutely professional. Their facilities were obviously new and well maintained. I met one of the owners and he was quite modest and disarmingly nice.,March 2018,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Apr 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria","['21 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",40,[]
Genoten van ons verblijf!,"We hebben 3 nachten in dit hotel geslapen. Het hotel ligt in het hartje van Victoria Island. Dichtbij het commerciële centrum maar ook dichtbij het strand, Hard Rock Café,... Naar de luchthaven van Lagos is het ongeveer 30 km maar omdat onze vlucht buiten het spitsuur was waren we er op een klein half uurtje. Het hotel is bijzonder proper en heeft erg mooie kamers. Onze kamer had een heerlijk bed en een prima douche. Het restaurant heeft een uitgebreide kaart, ook voor vegetariërs. Wij hebben telkens lekker gegeten. De bediening is er, evenals in de rest van het hotel, erg vriendelijk en professioneel. Het dakterras is super om de dag af te ronden en even aan de drukte van Lagos te ontsnappen.",July 2017,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Jul 2017,"Antwerp, Belgium",['15 contributions'],50,[]
