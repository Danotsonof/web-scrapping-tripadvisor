"Amber, not exceptionally Amber","The rooms are big, but not dope. The bath is still old century - bath tub, without a standing shower.  The breakfast is average, and the new policy of charging guests to bring their food ordered to their rooms reeks of extortion.  Very friendly staff.",August 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2023,,['4 contributions'],30,"['Value bubble_40', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
"Safe and clean hotel in a central location. 24/7 electricity, rooms are clean with comfortable beds and clean sheets.","Lovely hotel, 24/7 electricity, rooms are clean with comfortable beds, the manager Amarachi Kalu is a very pleasant lady, wifi is very erratic, so if you are planning to work, bring your own dongle to avoid the stress, be prepared for the Nigerian nuances such as one towel in bathroom for 2 guests!, (you will need to ask for extras daily),key cards deactivating each time either of us left the rooms!, breakfast is only for one guest- the other pays!, I was there  with my husband for two weeks and we changed rooms 4 times due to issues that could have been avoided by proper checks. The staff are very pleasant and trustworthy, our belongings were always left where we put them, nothing went missing. The food was average, I think more variety is needed.

Staff members are so nice,We hosted a meeting in this hotel and we stayed here. The staff members were very nice and I felt welcome. The internet was fast enough to watch YouTube when connected. I often had to login to keep online. The shower water pressure and temperature were good. There was a hole in the bathroom and I was afraid some bugs/insects could crawl in but nothing happened. I will come back if we host a meeting here again. It was an affordable option compare to other choices in the region.,May 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review May 2023,"Vienna, Austria","['875 contributions', '169 helpful votes']",30,[]
Weekend getaway,"Visited Amber Residence for a weekend getaway with the family.   I had called to make a reservation during the week but it could not be located when i checked in, it took quite sometime for that to be sorted but the front desk staff was polite and professional. I got a Standard Double on the 2nd floor.   The room was spacious, neat and cozy, i didnt get a room with a view which was rather disappointing. At night the Airconditioning was quite loud and kept sounding like it was raining which was also discomforting. Water Pressure in the bath  was better than most hotels in Nigeria with the heating consistent throughout.   Breakfast was a bit lackluster and the low-point of my stay, the menu was not robust to choose from. We also had differing information on the cost for extra",August 2021,,,wrote a review Aug 2021,"Lagos, Nigeria","['63 contributions', '40 helpful votes']",30,"['Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"
Quite decent,"Very serene environment away from all the hustle and bustle: this is the biggest plus. It's ideal for business meetings. It actually looks more like a nice house on the outside. Menu is quite Nigerian - good options but for those who aren't used to very spicy Nigerian-style food this may be a challenge, unless of course you are adventurous. Overall, quite decent.",February 2019,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2019,"Lagos, Nigeria","['179 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",40,[]
Wonderful stay at Amber Residence,"Recently stayed here for a week, enjoyed very good ambiance of this hotel, neat and clean, very polite staff and very good speed internet that’s also free Food was really good, room services were very prompt Although Swimming pool was under repair but started working on Saturday  Had a great party !!!",March 2019,Traveled solo,All rooms are good and quite,wrote a review Mar 2019,,['4 contributions'],50,"['Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Fluctuates between very good and terrible!,"Stayed two different nights here, had two completely different experiences: First yime was small humid room with bathroom the size of an airplane WC and water temperature and pressure varied between boiling and cold, no in-between. Worst bit was finding an insect crawling on me in the middle of the night. Took staff almost an hour to bring me a hairdryer! Breakfast was adequate but unappeteising for a Western palate, the Nigerian dish I tried was lukewarm, which was off-putting.  My second stay I had a room twice the size of the previous one, with a spacious bathroom. However, I was exhausted and in need of a shower after all-day travel, so a bit disconcerted that they needed to do plumbing for over an hour after I arrived. Room also smelled very strongly of something synthetic",November 2018,Traveled on business,first floor rooms (200 on) are better but not past 214 as those are smaller.,wrote a review Nov 2018,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['105 contributions', '73 helpful votes']",30,"['Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Terrible on key issues,"Overall I would rate my stay poor but different factors were all over the spectrum from terrible to excellent.  Stayed here for 5-6 weeks while working in GRA, Ikeja. Was a business trip so my company organised all the administration. Think it is important to note that I am a South African so that my comments about the menu options can be taken relatively.  Positives: - Staff are very friendly and helpful - Management extremely attentive and really did try to fix the issues - Pool area was very comfortable to relax in after work - Grounds well kept and spacious providing a relaxing atmosphere to come back to in the evenings - Room very spacious  Negatives: - Fitness centre is very poor; equipment not functioning at all, weights fell apart in my hands - Internet was very poor;",June 2018,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2018,"Durbanville, South Africa",['6 contributions'],20,"['Value bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Nice and comfortable,"Nice and modern rooms with wifi, but with not so many amenities (no hairdryer, fridge with one small bottle of water per day).

Terrible customer service,Due to their greediness they overbooked and left me stranded in Lagos. Made reservation 4 days ago only to have it canceled 1 hr before i landed from US. I had traveled for 20 plus hours only to have this people cancel my reservation. How inhuman is that? This reservation was made and paid for too.

"Comfortable room and adequate food, but could improve on service, and needs to upgrade credit card machines.","Room was large and comfortable, with a decent sized bathroom. However, there was some mildew in the shower, which had the settings of burning and icy, with nothing in between. Drinking water is provided daily. The breakfast buffet is adequate, with a mix of Western and West African dishes. A la carte service is also available. The restaurant also has a lunch buffet that is re-run for dinner, with a la carte available as well. WIFI is ok, but frequently cuts out. The hotel has trouble accepting international credit cards, although they promise to resolve this problem. The hotel is very safe, but the neighborhood is a little dodgy, especially at night. Good facilities for meetings, and very accommodating staff.",May 2018,,,wrote a review May 2018,"Washington DC, District of Columbia","['15 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",30,[]
Pretty good!,"Access road to the hotel was kinda dark but on entry you are greeted by the clean and spacious grounds, cool small swimming pool, meals were buffet both for dinner and breakfast, rooms were clean and everything in the bathroom worked.

"Better than average but definitely not very good, the only other option TA allows at present","A small reception, challenged on check in, later on proved to be much more on the ball when asking questions and requesting for things.  Due to a lack of elevators was it a longish walk and climb up two floors to my room but as the hotel was full it was not possible to get a room closer to the reception on the ground floor.  The first impression of the room was one of enough space though small issues, on closer look, then dragged the overall rating down. Thankfully I had brought myself slippers - the hotel provides none nor bathrobes - as the carpet looked less than clean though the tiled floor was. The chair on the working desk was in need of a new upholstery, a problem I fixed by using one of the pillows from the bed. I also noted the lack of sufficient socket spaces but as I",November 2017,,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"Kampala, Uganda","['3105 contributions', '496 helpful votes']",30,[]
"""poor/terrible Wifi service""","The Wifi service at this hotel is terrible and after so many complaints nothing was done to resolve the issue. They kept giving an excuse of the IT Manager being off site and that the matter will be resolved when he comes in the following day, which was  never the case. I made the mistake of recommending the hotel after my stay to someone else and the terrible  ""wifi"" service was still an issue a few months on during their stay.

Transit,Arrived Lagos late so stayed here for a night while on transit to Ibadan. It's in Ikeja a short drive from the airport. Rooms are tidy and clean but the finishing needs improvement. Staff are polite and helpful.  Had breakfast the following morning.. Buffet style and a good selection of food. It's close to all amenities so went out for dinner. Could improve on their reasonable adjustments for families with children like providing a cot or an extra mattress even if it's for a small charge. We were offered a bigger room for nearly double the amount so declined and just managed for the night! Too costly for a 3 star..😏,August 2016,,,wrote a review Sep 2016,"Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom","['144 contributions', '26 helpful votes']",30,[]

Flight Cancelled - Sent to African Sun,"My flight back to the US was cancelled until the next day, the airline put me up at this hotel. The room was on the second floor, it was up a couple of flights of stairs, through a door and there is no elevator.  The room is nicely appointed, the shower is very large. The shower configuration is a bit strange but no complaints on a roomy bathroom. The bathroom amenities are nice enough. The room size is quite adequate for 1 or 2 persons. I did eat dinner, it is a buffet. I am unable to give a real review on the food as I was very limited with what I could eat since this is not my normal diet.  I arrived at night and left very early (4:00am) so I did not get to see the place in daylight. It does look like a nice hotel on the outside, the lobby is small.

"Not a very pleasant stay, room was good but food sucks badly..","Put up on 01 March and was in room 207, after my long flight from Kuala Lumpur. I must the room was absolutely cozy, spacious and nice layout out.   As always, every good aspect there will be something that will spoil the stay.  I ordered a pizza which just look and taste like a piece of rotten bread. Since I was little hungry, I had couple of pieces. Then I took shower, no hot water..   Also, the air-condition wasn't was as it was tripping constantly and I did inform the front desk to get some technical assistance to resolve it, however the so called 'assistance' only arrived at 10am next morning which made me to sleep without air-condition the whole night.

Good overnight stopover,"My company book this hotel for me when passing through Lagos. It is conveniently located within 15 mins of the international and domestic airports but as the Lagos traffic gets busier in the evening this can easily become an hour, not the hotels fault of course but it helps to be aware. Clean, spacious en-suite rooms throughout, some larger than others with comfortable beds and nice linens. Food can take an age for no discernible reason and while the staff are apologetic they cannot explain why a simple pasta dish took 40 minutes to come to the table when there were only 3 other people in the restaurant..!!?? Internet is available throughout the hotel with some rooms even having wired access for extra speed.

Quiet Comfort in Busy Lagos,"They advertise as being ""in the highbrow section"" of Lagos. I stay here when I'm working in Lagos. I's new, clean and modern, located 15 minutes from Murtala Mohammed Airport, and in Lagos that alone is worth the price of admission.   The staff are great, very accommodating!  It features an in house restaurant but you may find yourself going out to some of the various restaurants within walking distance.  The bar is a quiet place to get together with other residence for a drink but only open until 10pm if I remember correctly.
