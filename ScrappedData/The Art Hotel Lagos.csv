The best hotel in Nigeria,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Art Hotel during my recent visit to Lagos. First, the hotel is very aesthetically pleasing with tasteful designs, artwork and well thought out modern accommodations. The location was aptly secured and gated and in a very good area with proximity to shopping, the beach and museums.   My hotel room was equipped with everything I needed, very spacious and cozy with a nice comfortable king sized bed. Although there were many places to eat outside of the hotel, I elected to dine at their restaraunt on site, Mist. The food was outstanding with a variety of cuisines to select and breakfast was no exception.   Last, what I appreciated the most, was the kind and knowledgable staff. They went exceedingly above and beyond to make you feel welcome and",June 2023,Traveled with friends,Visit the rooftop!
