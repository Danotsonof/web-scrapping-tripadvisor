Nice Place. Friendly Staff.,Visited with family. Secure and decent location inside an estate. Friendly staff. Food not wonderful but an overall good experience. There are very busy streets nearby like Bode Thomas for your shopping. There is a taxi park across the road too.,June 2021,Traveled with family,Consider coming with a taxi. Very limited parking space.,wrote a review Jun 2021,"Abuja, Nigeria",['13 contributions'],30,[]

KSF PLACE - IMPROVEMENT NOTICED.,"The last time I stayed at KSF Place, the internet was non-operational. My last visit 2 days ago, I observed a great improvement in the internet, while all other facilities remained in top shape.  Keep up the great work, I will always return and would recommend you to my friends and associates.",September 2019,,Room 514 is simply great,wrote a review Sep 2019,"Lagos, Nigeria","['32 contributions', '51 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
"Secure, clean and good budget hotel in mainland","If you are looking for a secure and nice place in mainland where you can easily get to VI or Apapa, KSF place is one of the best options to consider. The location is good and easy to access. The environment is very secure. You can take a walk to the National stadium to relax in the evening. The rooms are very clean and the generator is far from the room area, so you have no worry about the generator noise in the night. If you love space you can go for the deluxe and you will get a good value for your money. The services are relatively ok, but don't border you will not need much help. |There is a complimentary breakfast, but not the full English breakfast anyway.  The restaurant run for 24 hours, si you are sure of getting food any time of the day. The food are mostly Nigeria",February 2018,,,wrote a review Feb 2018,San Francisco,"['47 contributions', '38 helpful votes']",40,[]
KSF PLACE - GOOD GET AWAY,"I was impressed with the quality of room provided. The only minus was their internet. The facility is very quiet, while they offer complimentary breakfast for 2.  Their manager was very friendly and ready to go to great lengths to ensure that you had a pleasant stay.",September 2017,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"Lagos, Nigeria","['32 contributions', '51 helpful votes']",40,"['Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
LAG Alaka... A place away from home like home.,Excellent hotel situated in an ideal and accessible location.  Rooms are big and spacious and very clean. Stable electricity though party powered by a generator but constant.  We had two room executive suite and a room and it was a pleasant stay. Executive suite was beautiful with a very pleasant view.  I will certainly stay here again and recommend to friends.,June 2017,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Jun 2017,,"['9 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",40,[]
Excellent,"Staff were pleasant and provide safe,quiet and comfortable environment. I must say the dining area is relatively small but the breakfast is nice but there is a limited range of options for the free breakfast.",September 2016,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Apr 2017,"London, United Kingdom",['2 contributions'],50,"['Rooms bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
"Affordable, Quiet and homely","I have used KSF Place on my last three trips to Lagos and no regrets so far. The suite in the extension are quite comfortable. The dining is a little small and choice of dishes limited... but if you wish to try Nija dishes, you would love it. Highly recommended.",September 2016,Traveled on business,The Extension has better rooms,wrote a review Feb 2017,,"['16 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30']"
Affordable & nice,"Great place to stay, friendly and accommodating staff, clean rooms, nice amenities and facilities. Only downside is the variety of breakfast choice. Omelettes every morning for 2 weeks was quite repetitive.",March 2016,,,wrote a review May 2016,,['1 contribution'],40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
Nice Quiet place,The hotel is a relatively small place but it is well maintained. The 'suite' I stayed in is just an extension of a regular room as the toilet/vat facilities open directly into the sitting room. The best issue is the quiet ambience which worked well for me.,April 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2016,"Staten Island, New York","['196 contributions', '84 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30']"

Excellent Hotel by any standards,Stayed here for a week in October 2015. The hotel is of excellent quality and in a safe environment. The staff are friendly and honest. The rooms and surrounding are clean and maintained to a good standard. I would recommend this hotel and hope they keep up the excellent service.,October 2015,,,wrote a review Feb 2016,"Atlanta, Georgia","['23 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",40,[]
Very good,"I honestly loved the place. To me cleanliness matters, and that is what i got at KSF. The beds were clean with very white linen that are changed everyday. The staff was very friendly from the oldman at the gate to the receptionists. The food was nice but a little bit expensive. Do not expect much for the free breakfast they offer. For example they offer cereals with powdered milk but you need to buy water to mix with it. It is located in a safe place. I overall loved it and can definitely recommend it.",September 2014,,,wrote a review Mar 2015,"Arusha, Tanzania","['10 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",40,[]
Boutique hotel,"We chose to stay in KSF place due to it's proximity to Lagos mainland and the island. The rooms are modern and clean. Staff are very pleasant, the choice available for breakfast was limited but adequate. As the hotel is situated on a private estate, it is quite secluded which is great to get away from the hustle and bustle of Lagos. The shower did leak and we often found a puddle on the floor after showering.",October 2014,,,wrote a review Nov 2014,"London, United Kingdom","['1185 contributions', '113 helpful votes']",40,[]
