Made to Feel Comfortable,Comfortable accommodation on Victoria Island. The guest house is not large and therefore service feels personal with the staff being pleasant and willing to help. The area is mostly commercial but there are a number of restaurants and supermarkets close by. Breakfast is brought to the room and I could have done without being woken at 7.45am but this aside I enjoyed my stay there.,August 2018,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Aug 2018,"London, United Kingdom","['90 contributions', '77 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
