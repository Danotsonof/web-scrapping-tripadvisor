Calm and Chill,The environment is very conducive and charming. I loved their variety of quality dishes. I had an issue with my reservation and I thought it would cause problems but it was sorted quickly.

Visitor at the hotel,The hotel officials are very efficient. The guy at the entrance was quick to collect my belongings and the cleaning service did their jobs well. They put on nose masks at all times while cleaning my room. Their hospitality during my stay was to notch.

Recommendation,"Not my first stay. I have visited more than 5 times. It's super cool. The rooms are spacious, neat and service is impressive.  They can never disappoint you in bookings. They are hospitable. It is a place to visit because it is accessible.",November 2019,,,wrote a review Feb 2020,,['4 contributions'],50,[]
Underwhelming for such a facility,"The hotel was neat and a great ambience. The room service staff were okay. Unfortunately I can't say the same for front office and restaurant staff who were less friendly and seemed either tired or bored with their work. One even accosted me to tell me that I will have to pay for an extra guest for breakfast, when my colleague was a guest in a different room. He didn't care to ask, instead he started issuing threats. Breakfast was underwhelming and could only manage a slice of break and tea.   The concierge service was very good. I only didn't like the room being checked that all hotel stuff was there in my presence on both check in and check out. I know hotels do this but they don't do it in the presence of the guest. It is humiliating.  They may improve on that and decide to",May 2019,,,wrote a review Jun 2019,,['6 contributions'],30,[]
