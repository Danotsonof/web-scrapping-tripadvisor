Value for Money,"I stayed in this hotel in 2020, 2021, and 2022. I stumbled upon the facility following an over-priced experience at an international five-star hotel in Ikeja. Each visit was as expected, and the breakfast was consistently sumptuous and on time, ready sufficiently early to catch an early domestic flight.  The rooms are impeccably neat, and the bathroom is world-class.   The hotel is easily the best value for money in Lagos, and I have reviewed many for Trip Advisor and have been in an out of Lagos since the 90s.  The best part of the facility is its people. On this occasion, I want to showcase Mr. Denis Adegbe for the Manager of the Month ex-post for his exceptional customer service and courtesy to me in December 2021. The service far exceeded my expectations and had me",December 2021,,,wrote a review Apr 2022,"Decatur, Georgia","['57 contributions', '14 helpful votes']",50,"['Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
Breakfast eggs bad,"I went down for the breakfast buffet this moring and noticed that the scramble egss were bad, i complained and asked them to change the eggs, they did not, a lady guest also came down and took the eggs and was disgusted once she smelled them.  I asked one of the waiters why it was not changed when i asked it to be changed as  this could have been prevented, they had no answer.  They now offered me and the lady new fresh eggs to be made, I refused, however the lady said she wanted fried eggs instead.   When they brought the so called new eggs out is was scrambled eggas  again and the lady was very upset. saying"" i asked you made the new eggs fried"". she now gave up and just ate her bread and coffee and left.

Pleasant stay,"I get impressed with each subsequent stay at The Providence by Mantis. Welcoming and courteous staff with exquisite facilities. The menu array can be worked on a bit though just to create a wider array. All in all I‚Äôll still give them my thumbs up and hope this standard can be maintained and if possible, improved upon.

AVM S Makinde,Nice environment. Very effective and efficient room cleaning service. Very friendly and helpful  front office staff. A major setback is the meals that I would rate just average. The breakfast lacks variety while the other meals and particularly some chicken meals are tasteless. Nevertheless I noticed a marked improvement after complaining to the F&B manager or so.

Very pleasant stay!,"I booked this hotel for a relaxing weekend staycation for my birthday and it was totally worth it. I'm very particular about bathrooms and I had no complaints here, the bathroom was very clean and there was constant hot water without having to turn on any heater. The staff were also very helpful and courteous. One thing I feel can be improved is the breakfast buffet options, it was a bit limited and remained the same everyday. Other than that, everything was superb and the food was delicious",March 2021,,,wrote a review Mar 2021,"Lagos, Nigeria","['14 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"

Anniversary stay review,"Being a return customer I felt it time to leave a review. I was last here a a year ago before the lockdown on a honeymoon package for 2 nights with all meals inclusive. We LOVED our room. The junior suite room 212 is excellent! The bath and shower combo is absolutely lovely. The bed and 2 separate 50"" televisions makes it easy to multitask. Hotel service and staff and very polite, professional and eager to help right from the front desk to cleaners and room service. It's an easy choice to keep coming back bar one issue. The food is just not great. It wasn't great a year ago and it's even worse today.The breakfast buffet is pretty standard fare but the lunch and dinner options are frankly uninspired.

Definitely World Class,"This hotel is stunning. Not only is the decor luxurious and gorgeous but the service, staff and food were also excellent. I arrived after midnight and staff were still smiling. They had a 24 hour kitchen so I could order something to eat. The bathroom was sparkling and nicely designed. There was a bathtub and a shower. The mattress was great. I was able to sleep very well. There were two complimentary bottles of water to quench my parched thirst. I would highly recommend this hotel.

Truly The Best,"This is now my Number 1 Hotel in Lagos. I spent about 2 hours online looking for a place to stay in Lagos until a friend mentioned Providence. I checked the pics online and what got me to head for the was the picture of their bathrooms- very very neat. I got into the room, went to the bathroom, and it was as in the picture. Clean, I mean clean! The shower edges did not have a single stain. The room was very spacious. The air conditioning was easily controllable. The bed was super comfy. Buffet Breakfast was delicious. The staff were willing to converse with guests. Minus- a/c in corridors were freezing; they should reduce it. As long as I am staying in Ikeja, this is the only place I will stay, as long as the rates are low on days I am in town.
