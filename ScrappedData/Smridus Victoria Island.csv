Reviewing Sunday brunch buffet,"Sunday Brunch Buffet at Smridu is excellent. The spread is very lavish. Service is excellent (surprisingly they serve you, even though its a buffet). Beer is included, may not be unlimited, like the food (I had 2 glasses). All this for 5,000 Naira per head.",July 2019,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Jul 2019,,"['6 contributions', '13 helpful votes']",40,['Service bubble_50']

Authentic food,"This is one of the places where Indians go to eat, even if it is usually a hotel restaurant: good sign.  The food is absolutely authentic. Try the rogan josh, the best I ever tasted!  The hotel is decent and budgety (for Victoria island), just check your room very well about the bathroom, TV,  moskito net etc.",November 2017,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Sep 2018,"Kampala, Uganda","['110 contributions', '18 helpful votes']",50,[]
Party at rooftop,"Have been here to this property many times, I have seen it changing ownership, the hotel having different names right from Bombay Palace and now to Smridus. But now I should say the food tastes good. the starters good(may be smaller pieces would have been better to pick on tooth pick along with drink), the best part is the waiters and the way they have jelled with the Indian population which are the usual customers, wow, like their attitude and also they have learnt Hindi just to serve us a better. Hats off for this.the overall ambiance of the party room also good.",May 2018,Traveled with friends,Ask for good Indian food.,wrote a review May 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria","['247 contributions', '83 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
