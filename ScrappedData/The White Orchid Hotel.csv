White orchid,"Это обман! Отель в реальности сильно отличается от того, что изображено на картинках! Мебель старая, в моем номере не работали некоторые лампы. Карта периодически не срабатывала при попытке открыть дверь номера. Это совсем не 5*, а скорее 3*! При этом стоимость выше 200$ за сутки!",December 2022,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Dec 2022,"Moscow, Russia","['17632 contributions', '15661 helpful votes']",20,[]

Unprofessional,"Complain related to my stay in White orchid hotel  from the 23 February to the 28 February 2022:   The only good thing about this hotel is the friendliness of the staff. For instance, I was told when I checked in that I might have to change rooms for the last two days of my stay but that I would be notified. However, I was notified at 12:20 p.m. for a move that was required for 1.00 pm. I asked to speak to the manager and explained to her that it was really not right to treat customers like that. How would they have done if I had left in the morning for the whole day ?  In the end, I accepted to move in order to be correct, so I had to cancel an appointment to be able to make this move on time. But the height is that while I tried to respect the deadline of 1 pm, when I went to",February 2022,Traveled on business,You must ask for a quiet place and,wrote a review Mar 2022,"Douala, Cameroon","['125 contributions', '65 helpful votes']",20,"['Value bubble_30', 'Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_20']"
A lot of potential but falls short,"We stayed here over the valentine's weekend. Here's a summary of our experience:  Amenities - Excellent. Clean and nicely finished rooms. Was surprised they didn't have a spa available.   Customer Service - Very bad - they seemed all over the place. Communication between the staff and departments seemed non-existent. A lot of confusion. We got the feeling they couldn't wait to get us out of the door for the next paying client to get in. They seem seriously understaffed and the ones they have don't seem qualified enough for a hotel of this calibre. Seriously disappointing.   Food - Breakfast choice was very limited and portions small. The set menu idea should be scrapped. Breakfast seemed to take forever to arrive. It was a bad experience.   The finer details - On arrival, we",February 2021,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Feb 2021,,['1 contribution'],30,[]
"Classy, chic establishment with top-notch customer service","I stayed at the White Orchid hotel as part of a wedding party for one night and I enjoyed my stay so much that I booked the hotel again a week later during the Christmas weekend.  Pros:  Professionalism and attentiveness of the staff Hotel cleanliness Room sizes and appliances Proximity to other centers and activities Cons: Price ($240 per night is above average but was expected given it was the holiday and I am fine with paying up if the quality is there and it was present here) Room service (Room service orders were fairly lengthy but I honestly think this is a global issue, even in US where I reside)",December 2020,,,wrote a review Dec 2020,,['1 contribution'],50,"['Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
