Amazing,"Felt like home away from home. The services was a top notch, all I had to do all day and I was taken care of. If I had my way, I would rather spend my money and resources there than in a cheap hotel.

Fantastic facilities,"Funny you would contact me today for a new review as I sit pool side at the Hollywood florida hard rock hotel and casino. This place is it. It's all good, there facilities are top notch thru and thru. The food is amazing no matter which restaurant you choose and there are plenty of them. I love to gamble and there casino is the best there is and I've been to a lot of them. Everything here is first class and they've skimped on nothing.
