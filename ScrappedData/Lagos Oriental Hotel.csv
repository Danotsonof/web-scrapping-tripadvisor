HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND TERRIBLE HOTEL!!!,"This hotel is rubbish. The service is absolutely hopeless. The staff don't care.  No manners.  They are all about money and have no interest in ensuring that the customer is comfortable.  We made it clear we do not want rooms with cigarette smoke smell. They took us to 3 rooms that were not smoke free.  My son and I are allergic to smoke.  When we kept complaining, they made it seem like we were fussy customers.  The food was crap.  We ordered fried chicken. It was so dry and rubbery and tasteless.  I DO NOT recommend this hotel to anyone.  You can hear what's going on next door.  Late at night we could hear their conversation.  I checked out the next day cos I could not stand the thought of being in that space another day.

Worst rooms ever,"Arrived tonight at the oriental hotel Victoria Island and entered my room 1045. My my my what a complete let down!!! Absolutely disgusting. Dirty curtains, the shower room an eyesore. Two cocroaches prancing about. The pillow case had holes in them .Bare room. Dated decor. Broken furnitures. Leaking roof.

Unimpressive,"For a hotel at this price range, you should expect something better. The front desk was very unwelcoming, no smile, not at all helpful. The room although big, but empty, just the bed and a table and chair in one corner. The bathroom was very clean and the towels (but never complete) was always changed on a daily basis and the room made even though I had the sign do not disturb on! They has complimentary drinks in the fridge which included beer and soft drinks all free.  Breakfast was your usual typical Nigerian food nothing to write about. The dinning room was way at the back of the hotel, if it rains you will have problems accessing it. The table cloth were all old and cheap quality for this standard, very disappointing.

Exceeded our expectations,"My wife and I spent this year's valentines weekend here as part of what has become a little tradition for us. We would say while not mind blowing, it certainly was decent value for money. Having Oriki spa within the hotel is a huge plus too. The location is also excellent. Furniture is a little outdated but the food is good and well priced. The breakfast options are not very widespread and I'd suggest you get down there early enough or risk having even fewer options on your hands. Overall I'd say it's a decent stay.

Staff running scams,"Hotel staff are running scams   Called the hotel number listed on google, got through to the hotel, but then they cut off halfway through the call and I received a Whatsapp message straightaway picking up on the booking, they knew my name etc.  Via WhatsApp was told the most efficient way for a foreigner to reserve was via paypal. Did this, left a deposit, only for it to emerge that this did not secure a room.

Few Days Stay.,"Was very impressed with this hotel. The room was comfortable and spacious with sprawling views of the city. I absolutely loved breakfast! It was my favorite part of our brief stay  There was lots of variety, with both Nigerian and intercontinental dishes on offer. Room service though was extremely disappointing. This is the sole reason why I won't give this hotel a 5 star rating, but other than that, this is a great establishment, and I would definitely suggest it to anyone when in Lagos.",January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Nov 2019,Nigeria,"['3686 contributions', '237 helpful votes']",40,[]

Bathrooms with cockroaches, plugs and bare wires hanging from the wall (IN A BATHROOM).  As one reviewer put it, it is like sleeping in a huge empty office.  Do not trust the pictures, as all the furniture used to make it look good is is actually locked in function rooms.

NOT IMPRESSED,"Oriental Hotel Lagos is one of the top class hotel in Nigeria, but the experience and service quality 10th of July 2019 was a let down.  Our team was there for a business at lunch their restaurant also meeting with some lawyers at the ground floor lobby.  On entering the restaurant no one welcomed us, we picked menu our self, after 10 min we finally got someone to wait our table. The staff was grumpy, no smile, just came and took orders and went away. we have to wave whenever we need something. I wonder if this restaurant has a manager to watch what staff are really doing.

Bland but real value for money,"This hotel offers no frills, no service and no smiles. Front desk is grumpy. Only the gents that open the doors offer a semi-smile and a greeting. The exception was one waiter in the breakfast room. That said, my room was large (very large) and the river view most pleasant bot day an night. Avoid the noisy road facing rooms. Rooms are clean and so is the linen although towels are a lottery (always clean) but seldom a full set. It's nice to have access to a bath and separate shower.

Flummoxed,"So this was a last minute choice (special recognition goes to Mr. Jonathan who gave away our apartment, turned off his phone and left us stranded in Lagos on New Year‚Äôs Eve...but I digress) I understand that there is a hierarchy when it comes to hotel rooms.

Well, i will still recommend the hotel to people who intends going there for fun and to have a nice time out.

Still good value.,The rooms are big and housekeeping is ok. The free mini bar is such a value-add. Room service food is good but a bit costly. Breakfast offers very little for a 'Westerner' because it is targeted at the Nigerian and Chinese guests who are the vast majority. Front desk service is disorganised and really bad. Be patient and forgiving. It's better than getting  frustrated. PS: There is still no signage anywhere that guides the first time guest to the breakfast room which is on the forth floor if a separate building.,July 2018,,,wrote a review Jul 2018,"Portimao, Portugal","['526 contributions', '177 helpful votes']",30,[]
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE & DISAPPOINTING,"First I want to talk about how beautiful the hotel looks like from the road, I have always wanted to stay at oriental Hotel. The disappointment started from the moment I entered I was so shocked at all the empty spaces and how old it looked inside. My suite was so big but with lots of empty spaces which made it lose its beauty, my room had a bad odor which I did not understand and the wardrobe had a funny smell almost like the smell of pee. The Furniture is old and the tv had bad picture with very few channels to watch.  On my first night I ate from the Chinese restaurant, the food was OK but the customer service was bad.

Worst hotel ever,"The hotel is very dirty, one of the dirtiest hotels I have ever been too in a long time. They do not clean their stair way and there were cockroaches in my room! Their room supplies are very poor and I had to call for towels. The hotel is a smoking hotel, so right from the reception  that is the smell that permeates the building and this gets worse on all the floors. Their rugs were extremely stained and dirty, reminiscent of government run hotels. They served us stale fruits washed with salt so it was not a mistake. Their pastries were also stale. They however have lots of Nigeria dishes available for breakfast which I was weary of eating because I suspected they were to freshly cooked. Their pool is lovely but there a&e no lounge chairs!

"Lovely hotel, staff and great location","If you find yourself in Lagos, staying at the Oriental Hotel would be a good option. The hotel is in Lekki and is right on the main road (although once you are inside you could be worlds away from the hustle and bustle of the streets below). You will find check in and out smooth because the staff are both very helpful and friendly. Rooms are spacious and have all necessary amenities.

Dissapointing. Avoid,"Spent 3 days for work. Looks good from the outside. Bu this is deceptive.   1). Corridor carpet is filthy. Seriously the carpet looks like it holds a hundred diseases.   2). Reception made me wait for 1 extra hour beyond check-in time because non-smoking rooms which I requested ahead of time, were not yet available. When I finally got checked in, the room was smoking    3). Bed is comfortable. Room is spacious with lots of light. Water view is nice. But room is bare an devoid of any attempt at interior decoration. It's like sleeping in an office.   4). Card keys stop working each day I return. Have to wait 30minutes for someone to get a replacement. Reception is a long walk away.   5). Breakfast buffet was okay. Good. But the hot food was cold.   6).

A Top Rank Hotel,Lagos Oriental belongs in the top league in every respect. Booking and check in were smooth because of the customer friendly staff. The food is very good and can be prepared to suit your need and test. Breakfast is served a long way away from the rooms which affords guests the opportunity to engage in early morning exercise before the first meal of the day. When I wanted a taxi to the airport after my engagements in Lagos it was ready in a jiffy and I reached the airport in good time in spite of the road construction taking place around Oshodi.

A regal establishment with a touch of grandure.,It has been two years since my last stay at the Oriental. Very little has changed. Just the move of the lobby restaurant which moved to floor 4. Pity that there is no signage whatsoever to direct one to the new venue.  The rooms are huge compared to other hotels and the river view rooms have big windows. It is a relaxing view in a hectic city. Food in the hotel is primarily Chinese with Japanese as the other choice. There is a Nigerian breakfast buffet option too.

One of the best hotels in Lagos,"I have stayed in the Oriental hotel on several occasions. Good continental breakfast, the staff can be sometimes really excellent and sometimes really horrible. If you have any issues, you can call the managers (they are both German and really helpful).

A good hotel for a large meeting,"I have just finished hosting a fairly large conference at this hotel and it went as well as these things can given the challenges you face getting everybody safely to and from Nigeria.  It is a very Chinese hotel: huge with large areas that don't seem to do anything.  The layout is a bit confusing, but you get used to it.  I spent the week on the 9th floor - they seem to have a number of floors with nothing on them and there is an area under the breakfast room that is lit up, but not used.  Who knows what that if for!  At one end, there is a 'ball room' as capacious as any you will see - simply massive - and heaven knows what it is like when a giant wedding is on.

Some dirty staff too (leaving a trail of smell behind them in the corridors and elevators). The walls are paper thin and you can hear the nerbor's room doorbell in the middle of the night as if it was in your room. Not to mention conversations, TV and... intimacy.

"Have a Drink by the Pool, Overlooking the Lagoon","I can't compare this hotel to others in Lagos, because this was my first visit, but I would return. Check-in was friendly and relatively efficient. My room was huge, too big probably because the TV was too far away to watch from the bed or sofa, and the furniture looked inadequate. as noted by others, the view is lovely.  The restaurants are Chinese, Japanese, and a new hotpot one. True, Western food is under-represented, but the name of the hotel after all, is ""Oriental"". The breakfast buffet was a bit limited.

The hotel takes MC and Visa but not Amex and has two good Japanese and Chinese restaurants in house. The WiFi in room can be very limited but house keeping fixed it using a signal booster. The rooms also offer Internet by cable which is helpful. The staff are friendly and helpful. If you are Chinese, its like home from home. Even if you are not Chinese, the hotel is pleasant but there are also Four Points and Intercontinental nearby if you are looking for choice.",March 2014,,,wrote a review Mar 2014,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","['2285 contributions', '710 helpful votes']",30,[]

Chauvinistic Staff.....Shame! Shame!! Shame!!!,"This is the most chauvinistic hotel ever and that is the only reason why i am giving it a 3 star. This is my husband's preferred hotel whenever he is in Lagos on business and i have stayed here with him many times. This time i decided to run a 3 days chauvinistic diagnostic run on the  hotel staffers, from  title, you can guess what their grade was. I realized anytime my husband and I were together, the staff always acknowledged him, completely ignoring me as if i was invisible, i found this very annoying, irritating and disrespectfully. I believe as a staff of an establishment it is your job to make your guests feel welcomed and comfortable. it is your job to smile, say hello and be generally friendly, this is what the hospitality business is all about. it does not matter what",February 2015,,,wrote a review Feb 2015,"New York, New York, United States","['320 contributions', '59 helpful votes']",30,[]
Decent hotel in Lagos,"I stayed at the Lagos Oriental hotel on a business trip. Check in was smooth, with no problems. Now getting to the room, it was very large but lacked character and soul, just felt very empty with all that space. However, the view of the lagoon made up for this as it was calming.  The food was quite nice, I had jollof rice at the restaurant in the hotel and this was very nice. Also some suya by the pool made it even more relaxing with the view of both the pool and the lagoon.  Make sure you take along your mosquito repellant so you can enjoy being outside without worrying about being bitten.  The staff were accommodating which was nice. I attended a conference at the hotel and the ball room was very nice and spacious with the right decor.   Overall, for lagos standard, I'd say",June 2014,,,wrote a review Feb 2015,"London, United Kingdom","['143 contributions', '59 helpful votes']",40,[]
Large Rooms,"I liked the stay at the hotel. I had a room with a great view at the water body. The rooms were very spacious, too spacious actually. The overall arrangement of the room can be improved as it is difficult to watch TV while on the bed.The bathrooms were immaculately clean. I had ordered a fried rice on one of the days the serving was good for 3 people! The fried rice was good though. The breakfast was average but the pancakes were delicious. One of the main cons was that the wifi did not work and I had to work with a LAN cable on my laptop. Overall I did enjoy my stay here.",January 2015,,,wrote a review Jan 2015,"Bengaluru, India","['8 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",40,[]
Very Basic Breakfast,"I had breakfast at this hotel a couple of weeks ago. I was not very impressed. I believe this hotel is rated 4 stars but the service and dining experience was 2 stars.  I would expect every hotel to get breakfast right. No smoked salmon, cooked mushrooms, sauces, sausage was only chicken.....the list is endless. They had a few variety of pasteries which were nice, no whole wheat bread..... vegetables for Spanish omelette was limited. You got the feeling that they were pinching pennies. We paid N5500 (about $29)  per head  The service was not anything to write home about but that is not unusual for Lagos hotels. No one seem to be happy serving you.  I wouldn't stay here judging by the poor service and offerings at the breakfast room",December 2014,,,wrote a review Jan 2015,Lagos,"['285 contributions', '359 helpful votes']",30,[]
Rather soulless but adequate,I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip. This was just about the most sparsely decorated hotel I have ever stayed in and along with the scale of the rooms and public areas this gives it all a rather impersonal feel.   Room and bathroom were huge and comfortable but rather basic. No wifi in room but cable available to connect pc. Breakfast was a good selection of oriental cuisine and nice fresh made omlettes. Everything else was fairly ordinary.   There is a Japanese and Chinese restaurant in the hotel which I didn't try but the fish I ordered on room service was fresh and in generous proportions. The pool bar next to the lagoon is quite pleasant but the upstairs indoor bar is for chain smoking pool players only.   Not bad value for the price.

Such a dissapointment!,"Overall Experience ‚Äì I liked that there was enough parking and the hotel is in a gated space so your car is safe. I also liked that there was electricity the whole time we stayed there. The air conditioning worked the whole time. There was hot water to shower with and the water pressure was decent. On the other hand, the check-in experience wasn‚Äôt the best; it‚Äôd have been good if we didn‚Äôt have to wait that long for keys. In addition, the lack of wifi was a huge turn-off. If you‚Äôre travelling for business purposes and require internet connection in your room, this hotel shouldn‚Äôt be your first choice (whether you‚Äôre in the 40k room or 300k room). Luckily for us we‚Äôd brought along a router so we had internet access. I‚Äôd have also liked to be able to pay for breakfast in my room",October 2014,,,wrote a review Oct 2014,"Miami Beach, Florida","['2 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",20,[]
Alluring View,"Loved the view. The room was massive with huge windows and had an upper floor accessible via stairs with a big bedroom there while the lower floor had a bar area, dining, a small guest bedroom, toilet and living room space. It was clean and the decor n furnishings were lovely.We went for a wedding in the hotel hall which was big and lit up by chandeliers, the food was nice as well. Its has the feel of a home and is nice for if you want to have friends over during the day because its very spacious and you have the privacy of having the main bedroom upstairs.",December 2013,,,wrote a review Oct 2014,"Abuja, Nigeria","['687 contributions', '112 helpful votes']",40,[]
Business Hotel in Lagos,"I have stayed here a few times and have always found it to be good value (for Lagos) and all services and amenities are ok as well. The rooms are fairly big with high ceilings (this must be the Chinese influence on the architecture!) and generally, I find this hotel to be a reliable business standard hotel with a distinctly Chinese influence on the architecture and interiors.",July 2014,,,wrote a review Jul 2014,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","['2285 contributions', '710 helpful votes']",30,[]
Good hotel (for Lagos),"I have stayed at this hotel on multiple occasions. We usually stay in a 'suite'. This means top price in order to ensure there is some comfort with the amenities. Trip duration spans 2 days to a week. I have found the facilities to be acceptable when compared to Western hotels but grossly overpriced. Then again this is the norm for Nigeria. (particularly Lagos) 3 star accommodation at 5 star prices.  While the lobby is of acceptable standard, the rooms are a definite dip in that standard. The furniture is clearly manufactured on site or somewhere in Nigeria or China. The bedding is vaguely uncomfortable and the chairs are a quality I have never seen before. Interesting if not laughable.

If in V.I. don't look any further,"Having stayed in many hotels in Lagos without doubt The Oriental is the best.  Typically rooms elsewhere tend to be rather small and very dated in their appearance and in the levels of maintenance, not so here. The German manager ensures that if you do have a question or an issue that needs resolving then it is, immediately.  I wonder if he ever sleeps,  he is the consumate professional. Lovely large rooms,  usually with views of the lagoon, and a free mini-bar which is restocked daily! My favourite was Protea Hotels, and if you want a smaller hotel then stay there, but for me the room sizes and bathrooms steer me here every time.",August 2012,,,wrote a review Sep 2012,"Guisborough, United Kingdom","['8 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",40,[]
Nice but...,"I only stayed here for one night. It is quite expensive and doesn't quite live up to the charge. However it is a nice clean upscale hotel. The rooms are very spacious and the bathroom is massive with an enclosed shower stall as well as a tub. The bed is the best thing about the room, you could sleep for 24 hours straight. The room arrangement was not well thought out, there is no socket close enough to plug in the bedside lamp, and light switches are way across the room from the bed so I had to get out of bed switch off the lights and then grope my way back in the dark. The hotel is located in a safe and easily accessible area right by the Lekki tollgate.",May 2012,,,wrote a review Jul 2012,"Lagos, Nigeria","['53 contributions', '15 helpful votes']",40,[]
stay here if you can afford it,"Stayed here on business in May 2012. Just to echo what most of the other reviewers say, the general quality of the hotel is very high for Nigerian standards. The best things for me were the incredibly large rooms, the breakfast, the gym and the good attitude of the staff. It's very expensive but that's true of most places in Nigeria. The difference here is that you almost get what you paid for!",May 2012,,,wrote a review Jul 2012,"Dartford, United Kingdom","['54 contributions', '102 helpful votes']",40,[]
Best Hotel in Lagos!,"The Oriental Hotel is a beautiful property - not just for Lagos standards. All of the rooms are very large. Even the basic rooms are very spacious. All of the rooms feature lovely chandeliers, flat screen tv's, and large comfortable beds. The washrooms are huge. Each of them has a glass enclosed shower and a sunken or stand alone claw foot tub. There are dual sinks and the hotel automatically provides you with basic toiletry necessities including toothbrushes and toothpaste. They also provide you with slippers which is a nice touch.   The restaurant and room service food is delicious. The service is a bit slow at times but you just have to call your waiter over to get whatever you want. I found this to be true for most Nigerian establishments. Patrons should keep in mind that",May 2012,,,wrote a review Jun 2012,"Toronto, Canada","['24 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,[]
Space and luxury,This hotel offers luxury and space. I could not believe the size of the room we had and this was a basic room. The rooms all have great views over the river. the room comes with everything you would expect. it also comes with complementary soft drinks and beer in the mini-bar. This is very unusual from my experience of Nigerian Hotels. The staff are very attentive and courtious and went out of their way to make our stay very comfortable.,February 2012,,,wrote a review Mar 2012,"Southport, United Kingdom","['30 contributions', '26 helpful votes']",40,[]
Not bad,"The rooms are spacious and nicely furnished. The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool, and a gym. The view overlooks the lagoon to one side and the highway to the other. Breakfast was OK, The drinks in the mini bar were complimentary. It was interesting to note that the staff who took me to my room informed me about the foreign cuisine on offer in detail but made no mention of the Nigerian menu until I asked for it. It's quite pricey by Nigerian living standards, but has all you need for a comfortable stay in Lagos.",November 2011,,,wrote a review Feb 2012,"London, United Kingdom","['30 contributions', '22 helpful votes']",30,[]
Expensive little gem in Lagos,"My sister and I spent the night before her wedding at the Oriental Hotel. We checked into one of the suites and the first thing I though was ""nice but too small to be tagged a suite"".  The room was a nice size, though a fraction of the size of a suite at most top class hotels. The reception area was larger than the bedroom and they were separated only by a floor to sealing partition. Not much for privacy because anyone in the reception could see into the bedroom.  The bed was large and very comfortable. It faced the window with a view overlooking the road (not much of a view). The bathroom was the best part. It was large with a nice sized shower and separate bathtub. The staff were pleasant and friendly. Management gave us a complimentary breakfast and a discounted rate because",August 2010,,,wrote a review May 2011,"London, United Kingdom","['34 contributions', '38 helpful votes']",30,[]
