Clean and homely caught in a time warp,"Room feels like a tomb because it has no windows that open. So, there is never fresh air.   there is a reason for this oddity; to dampen power generator noise. Still, it is a no-go for people who freak out in confines spaces.  The rooms and amenities are clean and well kept. But the atmosphere is stale even along the hallway because of the no fresh air cum heavy smoking habits that are pervasive.  The location is great. however, the dusty entrance messes up the polish on your shoes and is a bummer.  if you are a business traveler, you can't work in the rooms. there is no wifi signal; moreover the phone signal is also intermittent.  the furniture and amenities though clean are very basic; more like a motel.  I lived here for one month  but would never go back there again unless i",March 2018,Traveled on business,Don't stay in the dungeon. those are the rooms downstairs.,wrote a review Apr 2018,"Decatur, Georgia","['57 contributions', '14 helpful votes']",20,"['Rooms bubble_20', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_10']"
The restaurant,"They offer one of the best pizza in Lagos. The different type of bruschetta is a wonderful starter. The rustic setting and design gives it a particular charm, a genuine Italian look.

Pleasant but extras are pricey,Stayed for the weekend with friends. A very pleasant and peaceful environment and ambiance right in the heart of VI. I got a good rate for the room but I am aware that in better economic times it would be much more expensive. My only issue was the cost of breakfast and any extras. Outrageous ! Definitely recommend this hotel but go out for your breakfast and bring your own bottled water (N600 for small bottle inside!).,March 2016,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Mar 2016,"Abuja, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],30,[]
A  SERENE ENVIROMENT AT VICTORIA  ISLAND,I was a guest here on 7th September 2015. The place is so quite and serene that you will think you are at your private apartment away from all distractions. The rooms are not very spacious but of medium size and very comfortable. The staff are courteous and friendly. The restaurant serves good food.,September 2015,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2015,"Kano, Nigeria","['30 contributions', '24 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
"Its Ok BUT -- they do try to stick it to you with your final bill with loads of ""ADD ONS""","This hotel is OK just OK.  But they do try to stick it to you when you finally check out and its bloody embarrassing,it is a right CON TRICK  This is the worst aspect of this hotel and I believe its part of the management policy, based on the principle of many one time only visitors and as its Nigeria no one will complain.  The hotel is a no star facility, it is probably privately owned it does have some redeeming features but not that many.  Their first trick is that the room prices are not to bad, BUT they want you to pay up front for all the rooms in CASH  This is not untypical in Nigeria and Lagos.  However, I am always suspicious when anyone wants up front cash BUT what they do is they start to add to the final bill very well hidden charges, for example, you think you have",September 2014,Traveled on business,Be very careful when checking in otherwise they will stick you for another 30% on top of what you...,wrote a review Sep 2014,"Darlington, United Kingdom","['710 contributions', '299 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_20', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_20']"
To be avoided - not a business-friendly place,"I have traveled to Lagos at least 50 times in the last 12 years. This time, suggested by a friend, I wanted to try this Italian-managed hotel. The hotel is a small 30-room old and old-fashion facility, which survives only because of a decent pizza restaurant and the poor competitive environment in the Nigerian hospitality industry. I just want to raise two issues which I experienced personally during my 2-day stay in November 2013: a) internet connection basically does not exist. There is a wireless network, but the signal is so weak that it is impossible to even send or receive an email, unless you can wait hours! b) the hotel expects foreign guests to travel with a pack of nairas in their pockets, as it openly prefers cash payment only. Alternatively, they accept credit cards,",November 2013,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Nov 2013,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['11 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",10,"['Value bubble_20', 'Rooms bubble_20', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_10', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"
Secluded little paradise on VI,"I stayed there for 2 nights. I was charmed by the intimacy and cosiness of the place in the middle of VI. Swimming pool, garden, arts, good breakfast, very good restaurants and pizzas. The prices were however on the steep side.

relaxed in the city,"I really enjoyed staying here. It´s a perfect place to relax in the city of Lagos. Well located on VI, with a nice terrace and swimming pool. Wonderful pizza´s.

Very good hotel! I recommend it!,"I visited this hotel 10 days ago and have been there for one week. I was satisfied at all, especially if we consider conditions in Lagos. Service is quite good, personnel very polite, rooms always clean. The most important thing the hotel is safe.   Facilities are always available, such as very good swimming pool, billiard, ad probably massage, even I didn't have opportunity to use it all the time.  Maybe, it is more expensive than I expected for a Nigerian hotel, but it worth. I recommend it.",June 2010,,,wrote a review Jul 2010,"Stari Grad, Serbia","['106 contributions', '60 helpful votes']",40,[]
Manuelas not my type!,"Further to a recent unpleasant experience at one of your members’ hotels - Manuela Residence, Victoria Island, Lagos (27.11.2008);  Having booked in for two nights and paid in advance (always a mistake), I found the room comfortable, surroundings pleasant and staff friendly; unfortunately during the night there was the incessant noise from a generator.  Upon complaining to the night staff, they assured me that they would register the complaint, but no other rooms were available. The following morning when I took this up with the Reception Staff, they were less than helpful - no alternative rooms could (would) be offered; the only offer the hotel came up with was a change of room to a DeLuxe room - however a surcharge would apply, so no mention of recompense for my lost nights’",November 2008,,,wrote a review Nov 2008,"York, United Kingdom","['75 contributions', '70 helpful votes']",10,[]
