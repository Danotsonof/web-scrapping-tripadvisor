Fantastic Studio Apartment,"I stayed here for 4 nights when I first arrived in Warsaw.  Communication from the property management was FANTASTIC with extensive directions with photos.  The security for the apartment complex (2 buildings) is great.  The apartment had everything I needed with a hot kettle (coffee & tea), refrigerator, cooktop and even a washing machine.  The shower was spacious and clean.  Bed was comfortable.  Nice balcony with pretty views of two nearby skyscrapers (Warsaw Spire).  Access via the trams was easy.  Situated in the Wola District, it's not too far from the Old Town area.   A Lidl grocery store, Rossman's, & Pharmacy are close by. Not a lot of restaurants though, being the only drawback.",October 2022,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Oct 2022,"Boynton Beach, Florida","['874 contributions', '164 helpful votes']",50,[]

Average,"Staff are okay, room needs pest control. Especially cockroaches. Breakfast should be served when guest are ready to eat. Serving.

Personal Assessment,"The room I was given for N12,000 should normally go for not more than N6,000. I was forced to pay because I arrived late and could not get a cab because the hotel is situated deep inside an estate. They kitchen was not functioning and the building overall had very poor finishing contrary to the pictures displayed online. I like the concept of guests able to cook indoors with the provision of utensils suitable for a family or company retreat.",December 2019,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Jan 2020,,['1 contribution'],20,[]

Great place,I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again.

Not recommended,I would not recommend this property. The service was nice due to the front desk attendant. The other employees were very friendly. The breakfast was not as advertised. The generator was not working properly so we did not have air conditioning most times so it was very hot.,November 2018,,,wrote a review Nov 2018,"South Boston, Virginia",['1 contribution'],10,[]
Hotel Review,"Was not satisfied with the services received. Room intercom did not work, water was flowing from bathroom into the room.

Unexpected,"The building is cool and beautiful,the staffers are highly welcoming,educated,polite and forth coming to every request,but the furnishing aren't worth the price paid,it  was terrible on my first night,the wall fitted A.C, made noise all through the night,the bed broke my back,no hot water in the evening,the fridge didn't work.",February 2018,,,wrote a review Feb 2018,,['1 contribution'],10,[]
Hotel was slightly above expectation!,"The continental  breakfast was too basic.... bread and jam and Tea. Parking space not adequate. However, Wi-fi worked well. Staff helpful and friendly.  It would be good if a route direction from the airport can be put online to make it better for travelers to locate the hotel.  I would visit again but would like better breakfast.",December 2017,,,wrote a review Jan 2018,,['1 contribution'],40,[]

Posh Apartments 1 night stay,"Nice secured accommodation with A/C in good working condition.

Not confortable,Generator sound is a major problem.I think there give the best rooms to white customers and give the ones closest to the generator to their black brothers.The breakfast is just 2 slice of bread and plain egg.Its like what there give to prisoners of war.,August 2017,,,wrote a review Aug 2017,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",20,[]

The hotel,The hotel is really good but the service and room advertised on their website is misleading they need to correct it. The breakfast isn't great when you book double room it's meant to be for two people not one person they gave 3 slice of bread and egg so small to satisfy one person.,March 2016,,,wrote a review Apr 2016,Lagos,['1 contribution'],30,[]

Budget hotel with a touch of luxury,"I was skeptical when i booked this hotel. After my stay i had no regrets.   It is a small hotel with great potentials. They try to provide all basic necessities with the low rate they charge. Free WIFI, free breakfast, hot water, free towel and shampoo. Most items are imported from the UK because i recognized most brand names even the milk and butter for breakfast, Really impressed.  Stayed in their new hotel that was opened in December, so everything was new.  Well there was the problem of frequent power failure during my stay, but they had two generators to support electricity supply. Nigeria and power failure seems inseparable.  Service was not bad, but needs improvement.  Not a bad place to stay if you need a cheap and quiet place to stay in Lagos.",January 2016,,,wrote a review Feb 2016,"Chicago, Illinois","['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]

What a hellhole!,"Made the mistake of having another company book it without checking properly. Had to spend a night in Lagos as flight delayed to Banjul. First off, hotel is basically a residence converted into a guest house. Its in a residential area, off from the rest of the world. We arrived late, were told that we can't order dinner because there was no one to cook. He ""graciously"" offered to send someone from next door to buy us dinner from outside at a fee. no choice but to agree. the rooms were beyond ridiculous. Small, suffocated, walls made of thin partition, the world's biggest fan on the ceiling right above my head, AC works, but drips constantly, the irrigation line just hangs down. Bathroom was just a closet. The shower head hangs immediately above the impossibly small sink, and you",November 2015,,,wrote a review Feb 2016,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","['64 contributions', '26 helpful votes']",10,[]
Clean and comfortable,"I stayed here for over a month and also revisited the property a few times after. If you are looking for high end luxury this isn't the place. But if you are looking for a very clean, decent, comfortable stay, then I'd recommend this place. It feels more like a guest house than a hotel. There isn't a bar or restaurant nor a lounge area to chill in. It has your basic room and normal amenities. But the neighborhood has everything you need inside such as a variety of eateries and grocery stores. For the area I think the price is a good deal. One of the workers, Seun had very good customer service the other could use some customer service training. All in all they took care of me and I have and would recommend it to others that are looking for a simple, clean, place to stay on the",July 2015,,,wrote a review Dec 2015,"Atlanta, Georgia","['62 contributions', '16 helpful votes']",30,[]
Birthday break,"This is the second time my daughter and myself have stayed in these apartment and we have booked to go again. These apartments are so central to everything they even have two restraints on each side of their entrance, so if your feeling lazy your just minutes away from food. Staff at the apartments are friendly and helpful. The apartments are spotless very high tech and a kitchen fitted with everything from a washing machine to a dishwasher you need nothing here, just good walking shoes for shopping. Can't fault these in any way",November 2015,,,wrote a review Nov 2015,"Belfast, United Kingdom","['51 contributions', '30 helpful votes']",50,[]
Unsatisfied,I was disappointed at the structure i met at posh apartment. The location is ok but the structure looks so much like a residential place. No signpost or billboard to indicate whats happening in there. I think what i paid for outways the average service i received.

Our recent stay in posh apartment(August 2015),"Before our visit to Nigeria last month, my wife and myself spent some time thinking over a  place for our family to stay that will provide us convenience and security until we came across your establishment on the net. What you described on your website was exactly what we got. The service was first class and your staff, that is Oluwaseun and Michael were just brilliant . Many thanks to those two young men. We will use your place next time we are in Lagos state until we get a palce of our own. Sorry that my contribution to your review is late.

Business Trip,Was in Lagos for 3 days on business. Booked this hotel due to the rates. Was not dissapointed. Basic ammenities in place. Services was alright. Learnt it was opened recently. Not a bad place for a business trip.They have an Aiport and city shuttle arrangements which made commuting easy for me.

Home away from home,The facility made me feel at home. Had all I needed to enjoy my stay. The rooms and common paths was very clean. Very good for the price charged. Great value for me. Unlimited Wifi. Hot water in the room. Individual satellite decoder so one can watch unlimited channels. Electricity was stable while I was there.   The kitchen was fully fitted for purpose. Recommended that they should provide breakfast as complimentary for business travellers.  Staff was courteous and friendly but need more training.   Enjoyed my stay and would stay there again.,August 2015,,,wrote a review Aug 2015,"Greater London, United Kingdom",['1 contribution'],40,[]
Lagos Transit,Posh Apartments is ideal for business or vacation travel in Lagos.  Located in a very secure area!  The owner and staff are very hospitable.

Good owner / Poor Customer Service,"The list of cons about staying at Posh Apartments are endless, however the manager did try to remedy some of the problems. I will list my personal experiences and frustrations with this place.  I had booked 11nights at this poorly locatable, not so much of a hotel, business establishment. With no signs on the building and less than perfect gps navigation in Lagos, it is hard to find.  First issues we noticed are listed below.  • There was no hot water in the bathroom. • There were no intercoms in the bedrooms • The wifi barely worked • There was no restaurant in the hotel as advertised on hotel.com and the food they offered was very limited as 70% of the dishes on their menu was unavailable.  • There were slabs on the ground that would trip you or cause you to stub your toes",June 2015,,,wrote a review Jul 2015,,['7 contributions'],20,[]
Review,It's a nice place for a feel of home but the wifi was never stable. There wasnt phones to communicate with the front desk.
