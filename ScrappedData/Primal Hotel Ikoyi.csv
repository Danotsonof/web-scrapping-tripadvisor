Quiet location...,"Was in Nigeria for a short visit...having not visited in a while, I wanted my privacy as well as somewhere that was good value for money.  My friend recommended this location as he had been there before. My stay was quiet and the staff were quite courteous. I tried the food but was not very happy with what was on offer. Their drinks are reasonably priced...I would recommend this for location sake as it offers you easy access to the main hub of Victoria Island, as well as giving you the tranquility of being outside of the hustling and bustling that you find for the general area",August 2016,Traveled solo,The quieter rooms are those away from the main entrance as you do not hear the sound of the...,wrote a review Sep 2016,,"['20 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",30,"['Rooms bubble_20', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_30']"
FAIR BOUTIQUE TREAT,"This is actually for a sister hotel, Primal Hotel, Apapa, apparently yet to be listed. Lodged in this new Boutique hotel (5 months old) in Apapa, Lagos (Point road) and was general impressed with the sleep quality despite its proximity to a major road junction. It is affiliated to older branches of same name at Ikoyi and Ikeja. The facility is new but still ""a work in progress""__There is a small Gym that is not functional as well as a small swimming pool yet to be operational (see photos). The rooms are comfortable and clean while dining facilities need to quicken service. Oh, there is complimentary Wifi. The grounds are green enough at the rear but why the glazed tiling at the parking lot? This would be slippery in wet weather. A fair boutique treat...",August 2016,Traveled on business,Rooms on the upper floor and facing the rear are quieter.,wrote a review Aug 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['1348 contributions', '56 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30']"
Good value for money,The location of the hotel is excellent as it is situated within the old ikoyi district which gives you a very serene environment and at the same time offers you luxury which leaves no dent in your pocket. The rooms are spacious and the cuisine is top notch.,February 2016,Traveled solo,Rooms are spacious and comes with a sparkle.,wrote a review May 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,"['Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Value For Money,"The hotel was recommended to me by a friend who had stayed there before, it was the perfect location for me as i needed a very quiet environment to focus on a presentation document I was working on, The ambiance is serene, Clean and safe, the staff very courteous and naturally friendly, the food too was quite good,there was WIFI in every area too. Honestly the last time I experienced such a smooth stay in an hotel was way back in US. If I am to consider the combination of the location, service and experience I wont mind paying more than I did for my Room, it is real value for money. I will recommend this hotel to anyone for business or just relaxation, it is very welcoming.",May 2016,Traveled solo,"the room upstairs  facing the pool is nice, I like the sound of the water fountain at night",wrote a review May 2016,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
I won't recommend this hotel to anyone,"I visited a friend of mine who was staying at this hotel for 2 nights. The lobby had a damp smell and the 'egg' chairs were fancy but very uncomfortable.  On the first day, he had to call for virtually everything essential - from towels  to toilet roll.  Nothing on the so-called food menu could be prepared for my friend; everything he requested for on the menu was not available; the guest toilets did not have any toilet roll. When we sat down to dinner, my friend had to go order drinks after we waited for almost 20 minutes and no waiter came to us. The waiter finally arrived dripping of sweat and looking very unhappy.  I couldn't help bu ask him if he was ok.  I requested for a straw as the drinking glass was filthy.  Of course, the straw never came. So, I wiped my glass with",February 2016,Traveled on business,I won't bother.
