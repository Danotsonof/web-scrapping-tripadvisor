Nice and moderate hotel around surulere lagos,"If you want a quite and nice place where you can easily navigate both the island and mainland in Lagos, then this hotel is just a perfect location for you. The location is good and secure and the cost is moderate. They offer both continental and Africa dish. The Nigeria disk have good taste and at avoidable price. The generator set is far from room area and you will not get disturb by generator noise. The room and toilet are well maintain",September 2018,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2018,San Francisco,"['47 contributions', '38 helpful votes']",40,[]

American Standards,"I stayed here in May/June 2016 and Maureen at desk and the housekeeping were accommodating and friendly. My room especially the bathrm was very clean, no mold or smells. The bed is ultra firm making for a solid sleep. I had the room on the 1rst floor in the front- noisiest but bearable, Their free Wifi is not strong, you have to keep signing in as it keeps dropping, same for the tv. The bar and kitchen in the back is popular esp after 5pm with the locals. You can order rm service. the menu rotates as they run out of things. but the red stew and their breakfasts are generous",June 2016,Traveled with family,"front of hotel rooms are the noisiest, with the Evening drinking crowd and generators.",wrote a review Sep 2016,"Orlando, Florida",['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
Exquisite,"My second visit to this hotel and everything looks even better than the first time. The beautiful hallway, the neat and classy rooms, the timeless architecture of the bar and restaurant and the ever courteous staff puts this hotel in a class of its own. I was proud to recommend this hotel to my friends coming into Nigeria and staying in Surulere.",September 2014,Traveled on business,The rooms upstairs have better privacy.,wrote a review Oct 2014,"Lagos State, Nigeria","['2 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,"['Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
