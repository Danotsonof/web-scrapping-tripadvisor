Citilodge is just fair maybe,"Citilodge is budget-friendly (5star rating for price & location) However, quality of food isnt great @all + my items got missing. I reported but never got them back.

Segun,"Citilodge hotel is situated near many essential amenities. Stayed in this hotel for two weeks and enjoyed my stay. The hotel is safe and secured with friendly and courteous staff.

Staff Tries,My stay started good because of staff. They really try; arec courtious and friendly. But there was allot of noise throughout my stay + roaches in my room.

Turned back at midnight after booking online with proof of payment,"I had made a booking online in which my card was charged before getting on a late flight to lagos. On getting to the hotel which was about 11.30pm, i was told by the manager Mrs Stella that i should pay again and go sort out the card payment with the bank. After which i was turned back at the reception, this was after showing them the confirmation of the booking and also the proof of payment.   This i believe is a very horrible way to treat a customer that got into the hotel in the middle of the night with proof of the booking and payment, when whatever the mix up was could have been cleared up in the morning.   I would never advise anyone to visit this place as they have very horrible customer service.",January 2019,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Jan 2019,,['1 contribution'],10,"['Value bubble_10', 'Rooms bubble_10', 'Service bubble_10']"

Great service,"I stayed in this hotel with my girlfriend for four nights in April. The best thing for me about the hotel was how helpful the staff were. Among other things, we had a problem with our booking which was not their fault, but they were great about helping us resolve this. In addition, the staff were all polite and friendly and gave helpful suggestions for what to see/do in the area. The food was lovely as well (particularly the fish with ginger sauce!), and the room was nice and comfortable. Perhaps the AC could have been a bit quieter, but it didn't bother us too much.  I would say however (and this was not a fault of the hotel staff) that if you use the airport shuttle make sure the driver goes to the right terminal.

Extraordinary Experience!!,"Citilodge is amazing. This was our first visit but it never be the last. From day 1 the staff and management was absolutely impressive. We have been to the best of hotels like Four Point by Sheraton and  Protea Hotel V.I. The accommodation and courtesy sets Citilodge Hotel on a different level, a higher level.

I thank Wonderful Desmond (part of management staff) for his intelligence, inspiring words, and professionalism. I also have kind Helen to thank for a wonderful stay at Citilodge.

Not too good..,"Staff: the staff were quite respectful and helpful ... No complaints  Food: I liked the food, it was quite delicious only thing is it seemed to run out quite quickly  Room: the first thing that hit me immediately I entered my room was a very strong cigarette/tobacco smell... The last occupant must have been smoking in the room and I wonder why the room wasn't aired out before it was assigned to another visitor. Apart from the tobacco smell, the room itself was just ok nothing spectacular, though the pillows were quite stiff and uncomfortable.  Bathroom: the bathroom was just ok, though I think the mgt should really think about refurbishing the bathrooms as they were a bit old/dated.

Great Stay at CitiLodge Lekki,"We stayed in the hotel for two weeks and were impressed by the friendly and service oriented staff.  Mr. Isdore, the general manager of the hotel, went out of his way to talk with guests everyday to assure that everything was in order.  The restaurant is staffed by excellent chefs and everything ordered was flavorful and well prepared.  A recommendation to the chef is to consider daily specials that will allow for a range of options over a longer stay.

Falling apart,"I had used Citilodge several times in the past and was quick to recommend to friends and family. Decent room size, good value, courteous staff, great location. I have stayed there several times in the past. My recent visit however reveals the place is falling apart. Maintenance is poor, it took several hours to get a room key (I had to keep going to the reception to request someone let me in to my room with their one copy of the master key, EVERYTIME I left my room). Rattling air conditioning systems didn't make sleeping very easy. My shower had no pressure and I had to shower in a different vacant room. Several other things went wrong in my very short and disappointing stay (particularly disappointing given that I saw the hotel in a much better state in the past)",May 2014,,,wrote a review May 2014,,['1 contribution'],10,[]
Disrespectful staff and uncomfortable,"Rooms and hotel are in ok condition. One can tell that maintenance and upkeep are poor and is reflected in quality of rooms and hotel. Staff hospitality and treatment of guests (there were 5 of us) was disrespectful. Example: Water pressure in room was very poor (not good enough to wash hair) and reception staff told me that ""you should just manage with it"". When I asked to use a shower in a different room but again the staff member insisted that I manage and that I lucked out when I moved rooms (making a disrespectful and insinuating comment about having moved into a room with my friend). She offered I use a bucket to shower but the staff never came with it. When my male friend asked to use a separate room to shower he was granted the request.  Staff also made bizarre requests",May 2014,,,wrote a review May 2014,"New York City, New York","['9 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",10,[]
GREAT IMPROVEMENT,"When we  visited Citilodge in 2013 it was just average and still trying to get its act together but this last trip to the hotel has been an eye opener. I am going to be encouraging people from the UK to patronise the hotel because of the great improvements I noticed when we visited again for 3 weeks in January. The customer service is Excellent, the bed sheets very clean and white and the environment very neat. The rooms are of good good sizes. The location is perfect for movement around the island and even to the mainland and staff generally VERY friendly and CARING. I recommend this hotel to a Business traveller and to holiday makers.

Good Value but not the best,I thought the room was quite nice with TV and fridge. Fairly clean and good house keeping. The bad side was the electricity kept going off (around 50-60 times during the 8 days I was there). that needs to be sorted and other bad thing was church with band directly above our room bashing out drums late at night and early morning.

Thumbs Up!,"An honest review should make note of the negatives as well as the positives: so the rooms really aren't charming, and the menu is rather short. Naturally it's not comparable to the fancy places that cost three times as much. On the other hand I found the staff to be extremely welcoming, friendly, and helpful, and the food I had from the menu was proper Nigerian made and simply delicious. Every room I saw was clean, and there was no messing with the bills as you get it in other places. If you can offer reasonable rates for drivers you recommend and continue delivering good reliable service with a smile I'm sure many guests will be loving Citilodge.

Excellent,"I have been part of citilodge family for the past 8 months as a guest. I am working in Lagos as a consultant and I must say this is a very homely place. Staff try by all means to make you get premium service against all odds. Despite power problems in Nigeria, citilodge has generators and invetors that run for the whole day! They have just finished renovating the front office, restaurant, pool side etc. I couldn't see the reason why they were doing it because the place was still stupendous!

Isolated but clean. a bit pricey.,"Prices are at 25000 Naira per simple room - a bit pricey. WiFi in the rooms is free and working reasonably well. Rooms and beds are clean and comfortable, staff friendly. Not many TV channels. I haven't seen any other guests - so if you're looking for company after a day's work this is a bit lonely. The gym is pretty basic (two running machines, and one weight-pushing machine) but ok. I wasn't able to pay with Mastercard because the machine didn't work. Breakfast is a bit on the meagre side. Cornflakes, white bread, nescafe coffee.  Butter, Jam, and other things only occasionaly. Swimming pool is 7 m long - too short for real workout.
