Still Ok,It has been years since I last stayed at this place. Savoy suites is still a good place to stay. The ac in the room was well positioned/not directly facing the bed. The breakfast was also good. They could do better by changing the old sink in the bathroom. The towels were white and comfy to use. I will still stay there anytime.,May 2019,Traveled with family,,wrote a review May 2019,"Ibadan, Nigeria","['39 contributions', '37 helpful votes']",40,[]
Neat little place to put your head down,Staff welcoming rooms very clean tv bar fridge aircon very comfortable. In walking distance to a lot of restaurants making it easy to eat out. Guarded parking and a good deal generally. If you like soft pillows take your own. Otherwise very comfortable,April 2019,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Apr 2019,,"['53 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",50,[]
Absolute Blast!!!,"The hotel does with its says on the tin. Home away from home. I stayed there with my family for 5 nights and the staff were absolutely impressive. Special thank you to Mr Owolabi (never a dull moment), Mr Micheal (thanks for fixing my writ watches & taxi) and Mr Azeez (thank you fr organising taxi for us)   Mr Lanre (Although we never met in person) thank you for granting the late check out. myself and my family are indeed grateful as we would have had to sit down at the airport for 8 hours before our flight back to the UK.  If theres anything to complain about would be the strength of the WIFI as it wasn't working properly for about 2 days.  CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK!!!

A good spot for airport,"Stopped here on a quick in out visit to Lagos arriving late but heading out early next morning from airport, this is a clean hotel, serves decent food and has friendly staff. You could not ask for more if you need to be at airport early.",May 2018,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jun 2018,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['81 contributions', '62 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Early Check-in fee ????,"Got there at 4.30am and wanted two rooms at 31,500 each and the receptionist (Yinka) told me I needed to pay an “early check-in fee “ of 15k each per room for a hotel that had only 3 cars parked outside . Paid 63,000 after arguing about how stupid that was hen transferred into their GTB account only for her to tell me the person who confirms payment was asleep . Fantastic place .

Perfect choice for a pre-flight overnight,"I’m never sure what to expect from Lagos airport hotels, but I was hopeful as this had been a personal recommendation.  We couldn’t have been more delighted.  Savoy Suites is ultra clean, has friendly and helpful staff, a brilliant restaurant, and comfortable, equipped rooms.  Entering the hotel lobby, any fears I had were dispelled.  It’s nicely decorated in a modern style and very, very clean.  Staff were amazingly friendly, polite and attentive from the start.  We asked for an extra bed for my daughter and this was promptly provided at a small additional cost.    All of us being hungry, we ventured into the restaurant.  We opted for traditional Nigerian soups and they were really tasty and well cooked, with huge portions.  Everything in our bedroom worked just fine and we had",October 2016,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Nov 2016,"London, United Kingdom","['18 contributions', '15 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
"Good hotel, keep improving, I will return",Stayed here 3+ times between 2012 and 2013. Good location (next door to The Place restaurant in Ikeja GRA and close to Lagos airport). Clean rooms with hot water and reliable power supply (standby generators). Excellent laundry service. Good WiFi broadband internet service. Staff helped to print flight boarding passes (which accelerated check in at Lagos airport).  Improve staff training and supervision. Encourage professional behaviour of staff and improve remuneration. Ask staff to keep the noise down when they are close to hotel doors and external windows.,August 2014,Traveled on business,Rooms upstairs are quieter,wrote a review Jul 2015,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",['3 contributions'],40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30']"
Almost ok,"I stayed here for just one night with my friend. We intended to stay four nights, but we discovered the rooms were not as comfortable as they look. The wall sockets can't be made to charge anything, and when I called the reception, the lady that spoke to me was very unfriendly and rude. I told her I needed an extension plug so I can connect it to the wall bracket in order to charge my iPad and phones, she told me they don't have such and they don't give such to customers so there's nothing she can do. I got frustrated and asked her to send someone upstairs so I can explain my situation. Promptly, one of the attendants came and I explained to him how I'm in dire need of an extension plug since I'm unable to fit my phone charger into their wall bracket. The dude told me I'm going",December 2014,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Dec 2014,"Lagos State, Nigeria","['24 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",30,[]
Very pleasant stay,"I wasn't sure what to expect - I'd never been to Lagos before. The Savoy was clean and the staff was very attentive .... for the most part. If football/soccer or Nigerian soaps were on in the restaurant, service slowed considerably. I actually started watching and enjoying football/soccer. The staff was very pleasant and I was told when I opted to carry my new bottle to my room that ""it is my duty (to look after you)"" - how lovely and how un-North American! The high walls around the hotel and large metal gate and uniformed guards into the compound were daunting at first but ensured a sense of safety. The room was large and had its own air conditioner so was comfortable. It seemed that the bed was made up of only a box spring and no mattress but was amazingly comfortable if hard.",March 2014,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2014,"Mayenne, France","['28 contributions', '15 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_30', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
A place on the downhill,"This place is probably living on past glory! With upward price adjustment twice in 2012, overused bedsheets and unfriendly manager, it is only a matter of time before the bubble will bust. I have stayed at Savoy Suites a couple of times and have paid close attention to every details, the food is unreasonably overpriced forcing me to eat at Deplace (just beside the building), the only good thing are the exceptional reception and kitchen staff. The wifi is epileptic the few times I tried to use it, it used to be available for extra N1,000 but now free when the room rates were reviewed. I can't believe the management is not paying attention to these issues, I am shopping around and will sure abandon this place as soon as I find an alternative.",August 2012,Traveled on business,"Like a reviewer suggested, stay away from the rooms on the right side of Savoy Suites, the boom...",wrote a review Sep 2012,,"['76 contributions', '27 helpful votes']",20,"['Value bubble_10', 'Rooms bubble_20', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"

Conveniently located and good service.,It's my second time at the Savoy Suites and I am happy to hear some improvements. I use the gym which has all the basic machines. The staff at the restaurant are very flexible and even one of the reception boys (who works as a tailor) helped in fixing a trouser.,June 2012,,,wrote a review Jun 2012,"Turin, Italy","['64 contributions', '38 helpful votes']",40,[]
5th Time here and it just keeps getting better,"This is the 5th time I have stayed at this hotel and it just keeps getting better. Its very clean, the pool is good with new furniture around it.   The staff are fab and nothing is too much trouble for them, I asked for a different room and they moved me without any problems, when I asked for some food that was not on the menu, they made it for me, all in all one of the best stays I have had in Lagos.  As I have said before, this hotel puts the bigger ones to shame. The wifi is now free to guests and it is a good speed.  Can it improve more!!!!! It would be nice if the gym had a little more equipment in it Mr Manager!!!!  Give this hotel a try, it secure, local and close to some bars, restaurants, shops and not to far from the airport.",April 2012,,,wrote a review Apr 2012,"Washington, United Kingdom","['49 contributions', '34 helpful votes']",50,[]
Very much improved,"So this is the 3rd time I have stayed here. Things are happening. The pool is fab, the gym is working and we have even had a coat of paint. All in all, this little hotel offers better value than many of the other ‘Big names’ in Lagos. The staff are first class and nothing is too much trouble for them. Well done to the managers and please keep it up.",November 2011,,,wrote a review Dec 2011,"Washington, United Kingdom","['49 contributions', '34 helpful votes']",50,[]
Average and expensive,"This is my third trip to Lagos but the first time at this hotel. Having looked on Trip advisor before I came I was expecting a reasonable hotel as it had some good reports. The truth is that the only correct report was the friendly staff!!! The free internet now has to be paid for, the pool has been out of use for over four months with no indication of when it will be repaired and the gym was dirty with broken equipment. The inclusive breakfast is basically eggs (whatever way you want them) and extra beans would cost you £2.30. The choice of food in the restaurant is average. Security is very good and the rooms are average but a little small.  Other similar priced hotels are in the local area and offer better value for money, I did try to talk with the management but they did",April 2011,,,wrote a review May 2011,"Washington, United Kingdom","['49 contributions', '34 helpful votes']",30,[]
Secure and Well-Maintained Hotel,"I traveled to Lagos from the U.S. and found this hotel based on previous reviews.  I was impressed with the staff's professionalism, cleanliness of the room and the restaurant had local cuisine to my liking--though a bit pricey IMO.  My main concern was security since I was by myself and not once did I have any safety concerns since there were guards at the front entrance of the gate.  Additionally, the hotel has Wi-Fi as an added bonus for a modest fee.  Overrall, if given the opportunity I would stay at the Savoy Suites without hesitation.",October 2010,,,wrote a review Oct 2010,East Coast,"['1 contribution', '3 helpful votes']",40,[]
Very Nice...,"Having stayed in several hotels in Lagos, this will be one of the safest places to stay in Lagos. Close to the airport and all regular eating places.  Staff were very professional in their dealings with guests, most especially the Manager Mr Lanre... Only downside is the leaks you have in the bathroom while using the shower as well as no phone reception in some rooms.. Pricey but very much worth it",October 2010,,,wrote a review Oct 2010,"Geneva, Switzerland","['3 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",40,[]
What a find!!,"Whenever I’m in Lagos I normally used to stay at another boutique hotel not far from the Savoy Suites. For some reason during my last 2 trips, the cheaper rooms were always taken and I stayed in rooms/suites whose price is almost twice that of the cheapest rooms. I then started trawling the internet for alternative accommodation and what a find!! The Savoy Suites is everything that the other reviewers have said and I thoroughly enjoyed my 2 day stay in their clean, well-maintained rooms. From now onwards it is going to be my preferred place in Lagos without a doubt. Because of my busy schedule I was not able to make use or even see the pool and the gym.   The only negative thing I could mention (which is really nitpicking on my part) is that they didn’t have electrical adaptors",August 2009,,,wrote a review Aug 2009,Johannesburg,"['6 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",50,[]
Clean well maintained hotel,"My family and I stayed here  for 2 nights whilst in transit .  We chose  the cheapest room around 23,000 ng . The Room was very large , well equipped with a mini fridge, tea /coffee making facilities and even a hairdryer in the bathroom. Lovely laminate flooring and decorated to a very high standard. The price was per room and included a free breakfast which was simple but of a good standard. There was an option to purchase a more substantial breakfast both Nigerian and Continental style.  The swimming pool was extremely clean . The staff were more than helpful for our needs and I will definately lodge here over and above the more familiar hotels in Lagos such as Sheraton.  Another feature of this hotel for the weary traveller is the proximity to the international airport the",June 2007,,,wrote a review Jun 2007,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom","['34 contributions', '22 helpful votes']",40,[]
Fantastic place to stay,"My family stayed at Savoy Suites for a full week.  What a wonderful oasis in the craziness of Lagos.  Every inch of the place was spotless.  The staff was terrific and there wasn't a question or issue they couldn't help us with.  Food at restaurant was good, business center so we could check our email, and clean outdoor pool for our kids.  A little pricey, but worth it to have the safety and cleanliness.",December 2006,,,wrote a review Mar 2007,Southeastern US,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
Very contemporary,"This is one of the best boutique hotels in Ikeja, Lagos. It is well thought out and the hotel is decorated to the highest standards. The staff and very helpful and friendly and must I say, very professional. It has a gym, a pool and a very stylish/bar restaurant. Stayed in the hotel for a week and loved every minute of it.",March 2007,,,wrote a review Mar 2007,London,['1 contribution'],50,[]

Great Spot,"We just returned from a trip to Lagos, Nigeria. I have not been back there in so long - 8 yrs to be exact. Upon my arrival there I really did not know what to expect but once inside this Place, i felt safe, they have a round the clock security, the pool was clean and my kids loved it. The room are truly something to see. It was like been at a 5 start hotel back in America. The restuarant/bar was tastefully done. I was proud to be home. The staff was ever so polite and very ready to assist you with your needs.   I must say this hotel is AWESOME.. clean and very nice, it's also not so far from other activites and places to go. if you enjoy going out but been in the Savoy bar u will not know when nite falls because it's just so nice. All in one.. WHAT A BLAST.  Kudos to the owners.",,,,wrote a review Jul 2006,california,"['2 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,[]
