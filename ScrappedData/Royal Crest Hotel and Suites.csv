Their room is large that alone makes me feel so comfortable,"I love their customer service, the food especially their noodles makes me want to come back and I also love how neat and big the room is.  With what they have in there , I must say that the hotel is affordable",November 2023,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Nov 9,,['1 contribution'],50,[]
My Stay,"It was a seamless blend of comfort and relaxation. I opted for the in-room massage as well and it just hit the right spots. Point to note: My room was large with a spacious bathroom. Judging from the price, I wasn't expecting this much. Getting from and to the airport was also easy because of the close proximity. In all, I enjoyed my stay. Definitely coming back",November 2023,Traveled with friends,You will love your experience there,wrote a review Nov 8,,['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
