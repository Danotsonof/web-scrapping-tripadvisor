Excellent service,This hotel is exceptional. The level of service far exceeds most of the hotel I have stayed in the United States. It is a well secured hotel because of the private airport hanger that is attached to it. Henrietta at the front desk really went out of her way to ensure that our stay was well beyond expectations. I highly recommend this hotel.,November 2023,Traveled as a couple,You can arrange a car and driver through the hotel. ,wrote a review Nov 7,"Fort Wayne, Indiana","['2 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Best staycation in Nigeria,"It was my first stay in this Amazing property and I must say they deserve a 7Star rating as it is the best ever in Nigeria. Starting from the very moment you arrive at the hotel, the staffs are very friendly and welcoming. Then to the receptionist who makes Check-in so stress free, fast,friendly and interactive in the most professional way . Thank you to Grace the supervisor and her Team, the amazing young man by the pool Mr Yakubu, Ms Gracial at the welcome desk and the two tall men who helped with the luggage and also one time help with check-in due to busy operation which shows the level of Teamwork and flexibility in this property.

Legend by Hilton,"The property is in very close proximity to the airport which is fantastic. I met Henrietta at the front desk and she was fantastic. Henrietta was very welcoming, professional and efficient. She helped get us in ASAP knowing it was a journey from NY and she sent supplies and snacks up. The room size is   very fair and everything is clean to Hilton standard. I wish there was an executive lounge for diamond members. I just think the breakfast buffet should be less skimpy.

Disappointed Diamond member,"What sets a hotel apart is how they greet a client, how they respond to issues and how they make you feel when you leave a property. Diamond member (earned not credit card). I had a 3-day stay that went well (did receive an upgraded room) except for a noise issue which was poorly handled but eventually resolved. The front desk staff of this hotel are not friendly or knowledgeable, and do not appear to be trained on how to handle and resolve issues professionally, rather choose to blame the client and disbelieve them. Communication is poor between team members. Access cards stopped working 3 times. Breakfast is very inconsistent both in service quality and offerings and 2 out of 3 mornings I had to chase someone down to get hot water for tea.

DANGEROUS!! FOREIGNERS BEWARE!!,"My husband and I stayed there for 2 nights on February 6 & 7th, 2023. Horrible experience!! The front desk person, Daniel Momoh, was a SCAMMER, he started swiping our Access Bank card several times and locked up all of our funds. I received a bank alert on my phone that the transaction went through. But he was claiming that we must pay again in USD and he doubled the price to $400/night but the King Deluxe room was $235/night on the Hilton app. We complained to the Manager Mrs Willie and she was in on the SCAM as well. They were calling our room every hour harassing us and bullying us every time we saw them. In the end, we had no choice but to pay them again in USD. Only because we feared for our lives in NIGERIA.

My only issue is that the food from the restaurant isn‚Äôt the tastiest. But I‚Äôm sure they will improve over time.  When we tried to book our stay, they told us they were fully booked. However, the reservations manager was able to sort it out.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.",May 2019,,,wrote a review May 2019,,['5 contributions'],40,[]
Is this Lagos or What?!!,"This hotel is stylish even though there are private jets landing right in the yard, it is still quiet enough room for me sleep for hours. The hotel staff were very polite.

Great Staycation away from Lagos hustle,"Loved my stay here. Would definitely return - well at least if the price is right. The serenity is a far cry from the harsh realities of Lagos and is a great place to come ""home"" to after a long, hard day. Food choices could be much better especially for breakfast. Speed of service delivery could also be improved. But overall, the pleasantness of the staff matched the expected Hilton quality. Most importantly, my favourite Lagos hotel right now.",April 2019,,,wrote a review Apr 2019,abuja,"['15 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",40,[]

Best Choice!,"Legend Hotel Lagos Airport, Curio Collection by Hilton‚Äôs debut is really a masterpiece, the layout and architectural design is one well planned, detailed and a lot of thoughts were put into it. The hotel is located at Murtala Muhammed Airport (LOS) in the Ikeja district, the ultramodern hotel offers unrivaled proximity to the international terminal as well as an exclusive immigration and customs desk for private jet passengers ‚Äì perfect for corporate and leisure travelers alike.   The hotel is a blend of retro, modern and African art and interior design, there is a masterpiece iron sculpture of a dog and a curvy lady, it leaves your mind wondering how beautiful yet well placed this piece of art is and who created and crafted this wonder. At the lobby, there are three tall",March 2019,,,wrote a review Mar 2019,,"['259 contributions', '14 helpful votes']",50,[]
Never Expected Such a Fantastic Experience!!!,"Now I wouldn't call myself a snob but over the years I've certainly become hyper-aware of hotels chains, airlines, and restaurants. Now traveling to Lagos Airport is not exactly the airport of choice for me because let's face it, Lagos airport in Nigeria gets 5 stars for disorganization, mayhem, poor signage, crowded conditions, and has an overall scary factor of 12 out of 10!!!!  So when I learned that I had to spend the night in Lagos to catch a connecting flight to Benin City the following morning, lets just say that I was slightly less that comfortable. My business travel guy suggested I spend the night close to the airport at the Legend hotel and I was skeptical.  On check-in, I walked into  a lobby that looked like it arose out of a story book!

Excellent service. True to its corporate objectives,I lodged a team of Russian tourist (Geografia) in this wonderful hotel. We got good rates and were allowed to have 3 to share a room. This goes a long way to boost the tight budget as well as allow my clients to escape the movement restrictions and get to the airport during the Nigerian presidential elections held just yesterday.,February 2019,,,wrote a review Feb 2019,"Lagos, Nigeria","['288 contributions', '51 helpful votes']",50,[]
The hotel is right infront of a Hanger. Super cool!,"Their Customer Service is on point. There's this lady- Abike Idowu, she's amazing. She assisted me in organising a corporate event in short notice & she made sure that I didnt over shoot my budget & even went as far as ensuring that i even got some money left over.  P.S: If you are ever lucky to see the MD or MD's son, you might just get yourself the opportunity of entering a PJ. I would recommend they add that to one of the hotel services. Lool.

"Excellent Service, Excellent Staff, Exquisite Amenities and Decor","That an hotel exists in Lagos with what I experienced is pleasantly unbelievable. To make the experience even better, the staff attitude is totally way above what I expected and to be candid, I have experienced quite a lot in various countries worldwide. The Legend is in a class of its own and very soon the perceived competition will need to take a permanent and distant 2nd or 3rd position. Keep up the good work and service.

Best stay I have had in Lagos so far,"I stayed here during a recent trip to Lagos. The Legend hotel is world class, in my experience with other curio properties, this was pretty good. I was here for 4 nights while visiting Lagos last November. The lobby was bright, clean, spacious. The staff was very welcoming and friendly and pleasant. The guest room I stayed in was very clean and had a great layout. The bathroom was big and clean too. The beds were comfy, room temperature was well controlled. All in all I had a very pleasant stay.",November 2018,,,wrote a review Jan 2019,"Columbia, South Carolina","['3 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]

An amazing property with the friendliest staff imaginable,"Let me start by saying that when you‚Äòre staying at the Hilton Curio Legend Hotel in Lagos you almost feel like you‚Äôre entering a different world. The entire facility is top of the line, the rooms are luxurious and comfortable, it is conveniently located next to the business terminal of the Murtala Muhammed International airport, and the staff is second to none.   When we arrived we were impressed by the modern look and feel of the hotel, and we were not disappointed.   The rooms are quiet even though you are located directly at the flight line with amazing close up views of airplanes coming in and out of the terminal. The A/C is quiet, the beds are comfortable, and the bathrooms even have Molton and Brown amenities, my personal favorites! And the showers... a dream come true!",November 2018,,,wrote a review Dec 2018,"Denver, Colorado","['10 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,[]

Best Hotekl in Lagos,"The legend hotel by Hilton is arguably the best hotel in Lagos now with services that are world class, food that are mouth watering and rooms that are as comfortable as they are beautiful. i had such a wonderful experience at this hotel from Check-in to Check-out. From Lydia who showed great helpfulness at the Front Desk to Jumbo David who provided such a wonderful meal and service at the pool bar to Funmilola the hostess at the ""De Bull Restaurant "" whose exceptional hosting skills were apparent to Victoria who gave as a lovely cup of cappuccino.

Finally!,"Every once in a while a game Changer comes along. I believe this is one of those properties that's going to redefine Ikeja. It's right in the airport overlooking the tarmac and sharing a space with a private jet hangar. These  entire area is awesome from the drive in to the lobby and upstairs. This is one well thought out hotel.   Food is great (not outrageous but not cheap!) I recommend it for business meetings,  family and just plain hanging out.

Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Staff was phenomenal in this new hotel.  Breakfast buffet had many choices and coffee was one of the best I've ever had.  Rooms are large, comfortable and well appointed. There is carpet on the floor. There was an espresso machine in the room. Mattresses are comfortable but I personally didn't like the pillows.  Gym was a little small but a great view of the airfield. There were no free weights but a decent amount of cardio equipment. The indoor pool is not completely indoor.

Hotel above all hotels!,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. They have done an amazing job from top to bottom. No detail has been overlooked. It is a testament to the fact that you can have a beautiful hotel next to an airport but feel like you are in the middle of an oasis with an amazing staff and wonderful service. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel special. Everyone had a smile on their face and did everything they could to make us feel welcome. While you are here, you must eat at their restaurant de Bull. This was probably the best restaurant I have ever had the privilege to eat at.

Incredible Experience,"Wow! If you stay in Lagos for any length of time, you must look into making this your hotel. After opening only a few weeks ago, the Legend has created a new benchmark for the area hotels to reach for. The customer service was first class all the way around - I've never been more accommodated and felt more secure in my life. We dined at the on-site restaurant and were astonished at the amazing food and attention to detail. ( I made a little mess on my table cloth while eating the scrumptious appetizer, and was surprised when my host quickly changed it out completely within a few minutes.) My steak was cooked perfectly and we were twice addressed personally by the head chef Mekhael Estephane who delivered a delicious dessert on the house!
