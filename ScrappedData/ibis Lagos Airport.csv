Hotel in need of help.,"I have previously stayed in this hotel with mixed experiences. During my last three visits over a four month period I have found the front house staff overwhelmed with guests queuing up to complain, offering feeble sorties rather than to tend to the complaints and remedying the situation.  The carpets need a serious cleaning in nearly all the alleyways. Some carpets are utterly disgusting with obvious signs of food stains.  My previous go to hotel in Lagos due to its proximity to the airports has sadly become a place best avoided and in desperate need of help.",September 2023,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Sep 2023,"Lagos, Nigeria",['2 contributions'],10,[]

Terrible stay at Ibis Airport Hotel,The hotel has caught the lack of maintenance bug. I first stayed here about 5 years ago and couldn't recognise the hotel. Making the reservation on the ALL app was the only pleasant bit of my stay (says volumes). I was welcomed by a clothes hanger in the middle of my bed and a half drunk bottle of water in the toilet. The intercom only worked when I got a call reminding me to check out. The towels were faded and the room looked worn and tired. I have stayed at other Accor hotels and this was certainly the worst.  The only reason I booked airport hotel was because I couldn't book the Ikeja hotel.

DO NOT STAY HERE.,Horrible experience. Had to wait 20 minutes to get a room because apparently the system was not able to assign a room despite having a confirmed booking. The room had damp carpet which they did not do anything about despite informing them multiple times.

Ordered dinner that was never delivered! 😡,"Never had this experience in a hotel before today! I ordered dinner as a room service. The lady that took my order asked for some little time to verify if what I wanted was available. She later called back to confirm the availability and I went ahead and placed the order with her. After about 1.5 hours, when I didn't see my meal I started calling the number for room service repeatedly and nobody answered me. I called reception and the gentleman that answered told me that he was terribly busy to look into my issue and I must continue to call the room service number.

"If the company let me choose, No Way will I choose this","The Internet sucks... you'll not be able to stream online shows, but you can read emails. It's not only slow, it often disconnects.  The room carpet is stained, there's grime all over the toilet tiles, and even in the space between the bed and wall. Makes me feel icky to touch things in the room, and I don't dare to walk barefoot.  There's only bar soap, so, bring your toiletries.  The receptionist is young and cold. She checks you in coldly, you ask for water in the room and she doesn't answer properly (her name is Joy). Ibis no longer provides bottled water in the rooms but there are water dispensers on each floor so bring your water bottle. Or pay NGN 800 for a 500ml bottle.

Poor Lodgings with Security Risk,This hotel now looks tired and is no longer good value for money.  The check-in experience was really bad and the staff either respond to questions with retorts or simply act aloof.  A staff actually scoffed at me when I asked if points from my stay would be added to my Accor account!  the poor check-in experience set the tone for what was to be a most unpleasant stay.  My room was barely cleaned and smelled really bad.  The beddings were harsh and and uncomfortable.  Room 41*  (last number omitted for security reasons) which I was allocated has a faulty door latch and does not lock.  The room can be accessed from the outside when you're in there without a keycard!  I cannot recommend this hotel any longer as you can do much better for your money.,October 2022,,,wrote a review Nov 2022,"Lagos, Nigeria",['2 contributions'],10,[]

SO MUCH IMPROVEMENT NEEDED...,"On a positive, I wrote to the hotel requesting for an early check in owing to my flight schedule and was granted (am a Silver member by the way). Thus check in was easy and smooth, but the decaying facilities and visible low staff morale are complete turn off.  First off, the remote in my room was not working, I tried to use the room phone - that too had broken down and I was so tired to walk back and forth the reception. Thus I spent the night without TV.   The kettle had a faulty switch and was leaking water, so scary to use.  A whole lot of repairs is needed to bring the hotel to standard.",November 2021,,,wrote a review Nov 2021,,['1 contribution'],30,[]
Nightmare from the pit of hell,"This hotel should stop all activities. Shut down, refurbish and start all over again. Dirty is an understatement. Everything is broken down. From lights to fridge, to air conditioners.  Have spent the night up, due to the stench coming in to the room. Stained and torn bedsheets, stained extremely dirty carpets, windows. Everything is wrong with this place. Accor group this is a disgrace and a crime against humanity.

Typical of other Ibis brands worldwide the bed is simple and comfortable ditto the breakfast buffet which didn't have a lot of options. Still leakage on the bathroom floor.

Close to airports,This hotel was hard to get to do to road construction in front of the driveway. We felt safe once inside and the dinning room was comfortable but hot. Had a good menu but there again they didn’t have everything they listed on the menu. Had the grilled steak and French fries which took a hour to get but was good when it finally arrived.  The rooms were comfortable and the AC worked well. Several lights in the room didn’t work but with that said it was not a bad room.  One concern was the hallway which stink immensely most likely from the stained and disgusting carpet down the hallways which surely could use a good shampoo.  I would stay there again assuming I can’t find something a little better.,October 2018,,,wrote a review Oct 2018,"Phoenix, Arizona","['137 contributions', '15 helpful votes']",30,[]

decent transit hotel,"I was connecting from an international to a domestic flight in Lagos, Nigeria but that is not convenient so I had to overnight in the city.  The closest Western-brand hotel to the airport is the Ibis Lagos Airport so a lot of passengers use this as a transit hotel.  Ibis hotels are a part of Accorhotels and they are a mid to lower-priced brand.  The hotels generally provide basic amenities including a decent room, fast wifi, a restaurant (with complimentary breakfast, depending on which rate you book), and sometimes a gym and/or pool.  The ibis does not provide complimentary airport transportation, but can arrange for airport transfer through their taxi partners.

Windows clearly hadn't been cleaned in the last decade. Loose ceiling panels exposed a rusted and moldly AC system.  Do not attempt to order room service, as it took an hour and a half to deliver a sandwich.  Accor Hotels should be embarrassed to have this hotel in their portfolio.

However the noise level isn't quite ok, lots of noise from the adjacent room. The hotel was somewhat crowded this weekend I stayed and facilities were apparently overstretched. The ongoing airport road repairs made entry and exit to the hotel uncomfortable. There was a floor leakage in the bathroom, but sleep quality was good.

Going downhill,The only reason now to stay here is the very pleasant staff. The hotel itself is in dire need of refurbishment of the rooms and maintenance now is negligible. I drew the following problems to the manager on one day but got no response:  1 - One lift was faulty and erratic in operation but still kept in service. No sign of any maintenance being carried out. 2 - We were without hot water for 24 hours - no explanation or apology 3 - They have only about 3 cereal bowls. Any time you wanted cereal they had to find a bowl and wash it up 4 - Coffee machine not kept filled with coffee so just milky liquid! 5 - Front sliding entrance doors not working properly 6 - Credit card machines do not work properly - take many attempts to get authorisation 7 - Food quality and selection reduced 8,April 2017,,,wrote a review Apr 2017,"London, United Kingdom","['86 contributions', '51 helpful votes']",20,[]

Simply Not Up to Par,"Booked this property for a quick overnight stay as we were catching an early flight the following morning and wanted to avoid having to deal with notorious traffic jams that are typical in Lagos.   A quick note: there are apparently 3 Ibis hotels within relatively close proximity. We'd initially made the error of going to the hotel in Ikeja on Toyin st. though regrettably that obviously is a different hotel. Word to the wise: book this hotel instead. It is in a much better area with lots of eateries and the like around, the premises looks clean, aesthetically pleasing and inviting; plus, importantly, they offer Free shuttle transfers to the airport (which the Lagos Airport location does not).

Good room but some disappointments,"Clean and comfortable room, with good security. The atmosphere is pleasant and the gym is basic but not bad for a quick workout after a long flight. Most of the staff are polite and helpful - one of the ladies at Reception was great in providing assistance. However, the man who booked me in at Reception was spectacularly rude and should not be working in a hotel. Rather than speak to me, he preferred to grunt and make gestures with his hands.

Excellent,"I stayed at this hotel on two occasions in January on arrival in Lagos. The hotel is no more than 10 minutes from the international terminal.   The standard for a hotel in Lagos is exceptional. The rooms are clean and everything just works. For hotels in Lagos this is not the norm. They have a commitment to fix any problems within 15 minutes. On one stay the TV remote wasn't functioning, within 5 minutes of my call to reception an engineer arrived and replaced the batteries. All fixed.  Breakfast is a buffet and has a very good range of cereals, cold and hot items along with coffee, tea and juices.  The evening buffet is okay but make sure you don't arrive late. If you come in on a late flight it may be worth eating elsewhere. If you just require a snack there is a limited bar",January 2016,,,wrote a review Feb 2016,"Ikoyi, Nigeria","['21 contributions', '20 helpful votes']",50,[]
Ibis Lagos Airport,"Very conveniently located from the Airport. If you don't really need to go the main city, this is very ideal. The customer service is generally pleasant.

When I got down the plane I took a taxi and the taxi driver told me confidently told me he knows the hotel and drove me to that fake IBIS which is just one block away from the real Ibis. Later I found out that if he had been able to convince me to stay at that fake ibis, he would have been given a commission of 4,000 Naira!

Convenient and safe but basic,"Arriving and leaving from Lagos airport is generally a bad experience. If it rains or there is a traffic issue, which there generally is, then you have to be close to the airport to be sure you arrive on time. It can take you over an hour just to cover half a mile and parking unloading and loading bags is a mess. Ibis Hotel makes this experience easier and convenient before you travel on elsewhere in Nigeria or back home. I don't like the quality of food much but thats my own opinion. I haven't found any where else different and it is typical. If you are two in a room make sure they give you two of everything as it is not standard and getting an extra towel for example can take a long time. Forget the 15 minute promise and sort it out at check in immediately.

Good quality corporate hotel,"I stayed with a group of five for a week, which is probably longer than the average stay. The hotel was convenient, clean and comfortable, and most of the amenities were functional. The buffet food was reasonable, and we especially enjoyed the fresh fruit. The rooms were comfortable if a little soulless (a few pictures on the walls would cheer them up, for example). The beds were comfortable and the AC wasn't noisy and worked well. In addition, our rooms on the third floor were very quiet so our sleep quality was excellent which was great. The wifi sometimes worked in the rooms, but was better in the restaurant, although in the early evening we sometimes couldn't access it due to too many users.

Good choice near airport,This hotel is located about 20 minutes (with traffic) from the international airport.  This makes is a good choice for travellers who are flying in or out of the airport.  The hotel offers a shuttle service to and from the airport and I have found that this service is always reliable.  The hotel itself is comfortable with a modern decor but certainly does not offer too much in the way of frills.  This makes it good for a short stay.  Breakfast buffet was reasonable.  Dinner buffet had a large selection but only about half of the items on offer would cater for a western palette.  My major gripe is the hot water supply.  I struggled to get hot water in my shower even after running the shower for 10 mins.  This happened twice in different rooms.

It's an Airport Hotel...,"The name ""airport hotel"" implies that this hotel is much closer to the airport than it actually is.  It's about fifteen to twenty minutes from the airport, and depending on the time of day, this can be much, much longer.  Lagos traffic is a nightmare.  While there are hotels that are closer, this one is probably my favorite.  As with most chains, there are few surprises.  Reservation system is dependable, the hotel is generally quiet, grounds are secure, and there is an attached restaurant and bar.  There is not much to do around the hotel.  Once you're there, you're there.  Nearly everyone here is coming in for a late flight, and leaving early so the options around the hotel are very, very slim.

"Convenient for airport, swim and basic accommodation",My first trip to Lagos. Shocked at hotel prices which are way above average. This is well over £100 per night for standard Ibis quality. Meaning you get a small basic room with standard stuff in it and thats it. I did one night stay and came back a week later for a quick swim before late departure from airport. Although I've given it an 'average' review (you seriously can't give it more) it could save you a missed flight from the airport which is about a mile away or closer. That very short trip can take 2-3 hours and its chaotic. Food is safe and Western. Wifi works and its free.

To be certain - it is the ultimate non-lagos experience- you could be literally anywhere in the world for all you would know inside the hotel.

Forget a tooth brush and you're on your own.  Expensive bar. Very pricey.   Ask for a room looking over the pool if you're Nigerian. Foreigners might find the view of the highway interesting.

"Close to airport, no frills and efficient","Got a good rate through my company.  Simple check in.  Very simple room.  Exactly one coffee cup and one instant coffee sachet! :-) Coming from a long international flight and extra health checks at the airport, it was great to check in without any hassle.  If you are not looking for luxury or high service, Ibis is quick and efficient.  Would recommend as a quick first stop since its close to the airport.  Definitely not for a long stay, since you will have to get to Ikoyi/VI for any social activity.",September 2014,,,wrote a review Sep 2014,"Bangalore, India","['90 contributions', '44 helpful votes']",40,[]
Ibis Lagos Airport,"The services were excellent, The room was neat and clean just as always.The location is as I wanted it - close to the the airport and exclusive.

Meh.,"The Ibis has all the amenities that a Lagos weary traveler could want, clean sterile  rooms, consistent wifi, food that isn't spicy :).  But- the hotel is absurdly overpriced and nickel and dimes guests on everything. Buffet for dinner costs nearly 50 USD and is basically the same stuff they put out for breakfast.  I also had the unpleasant experience of having a bold as you like cockroach crawling all over the coffee supplies. To be certain - it is the ultimate non-lagos experience- you could be literally anywhere in the world for all you would know inside the hotel. I think they take full advantage of travelers who are too timid to explore Lagos. Additionally the staff is a mixed bag- there are some truly lovely and helpful people at the front desk but in the bar/restaurant",July 2014,,,wrote a review Jul 2014,"Miami, Florida","['23 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",30,[]
"Good, safe, and friendly","This is a standard Ibis hotel (part of Accor group).  Stayed there for business long-term in Nigeria.  Close to the airport.  The breakfast is decent with the option of making egg dishes at no extra cost.  The rooms are standard Ibis size, clean, and comfortable.  WiFi can be a tad slow at times.

Improving.....At a Slow Pace.,"I arrived the hotel at noon, two months after my last stay; I noticed that tea sets (tea cup / sugar /electric kettle etc.) had been placed in the rooms , but no bottled water. when I complained, the receptionist advised that I use water from the bathroom. Hmmmmm. Even for a Nigerian, the buffet lunch lacks appeal, no variety!. I hope someone is noticing. There's still no door man.

An “IBIS Hotel”? Hardly a “hotel” at all…,"I’ve used this “hotel” for only 4-5 hours on a “day-use” basis before flying-out back home. Thank God this was only a few hours!!!  For Management’s info: I was in room 137.  The “room”: you get in there and the humidity smell catches you and never leaves. The carpet was so dirty and stained that I could not allow myself walking bare-footed on it: kept my socks on and used a bath towel to walk from bathroom to bed… The walls were showing dubious black traces, like someone had intended cleaning them, and eventually gave up…  The “bathroom”: this was incredible for an ACCOR hotel. Mold everywhere: of course (kidding) around the shower the caulking was all black, but mold was also visible (clearly visible) on the ceiling above the mirror. The paint needed more than a touch-up.

Amazing experience!,"My family and I stayed for 6 nights; even spent the Christmas in this hotel.. It was an amazing experience for all of us especially for the kids. They had access to 24hrs internet, and they loved the pool, breakfast was awesome!  The staff initially took a while to warm up, I guess they were stressed at the time we were checking in, and however they were awesome throughout our stay.   There is a lot of variety to choose from during breakfast; even the most selective eater will be able to find their choices.   I am looking forward to our next holiday..

One star at four star prices.,"The rooms were booked online but no money taken so if locals booked we would have been without a room. At £240 for two rooms this place is expensive.  Stinky corridors stinky rooms dirty filthy carpets and dirty stink pillows had to use my own sheets to cover the stinky pillows. Slept ok though. One slaver of soap.  Breakfast included nice choice of foods. Ok service. No one to help with bags. Proper budget hotel but at over 50,000 naira a night an absolute rip off.   Stayed in a brand new spotless clean hotel in the east a presidential suite with people to carry bags for 27,000 naira a night and one for 35,000 near airport.

Bad hotel,"Being a fan of Ibis in Europe, so I am naturally down to the Ibis Lagos Airport. any deception, dirty room, sheets and pillowcases smelled very bad, as if they had not been washed. To wash me, a simple piece of soap and a tiny shower gel. The restaurant, it was a long time I did not eat so badly. The staff, I think, the bottom is key reception everyone speaks, and the customer expects, staff room, they do not know it exists a vacuum to clean the carpet in the room; restaurant I think that there is no staff, we never see anyone. ....

"Terrible Hotel, Exteremely Rude Personnel, Untrustable",I booked my a room from this hotel online thru a prominent online travel site. I paid for the room and got confirmation. I and my colleagues arrived at the hotel and this was when we are told they can't give us a room. They made us wait for 20 min not telling us what happened and why we are been waited. They were very rude and their attitude was insulting. They said they have a system issue then they said their rooms are under maintenance then they said even if it was not under maintenance they couldn't place us. So we asked to speak to the manager to get a refund or to be placed in another equivalent hotel. They said they can refund thru the agent and no earlier than a week. They offered us to place a no name hotel/hostel. We did not accept. And at the middle of the night after,November 2013,,,wrote a review Nov 2013,,"['4 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",10,[]

Good Value and Safe a Hotel in Lagos,I have written about this hotel before as as it continues to improve wanted to give it a more positive review.  Since it opened the resident manager Richard worked very hard to produce a very professional team and improve the niggles like the damp smell  in the corridors (now no more) and slow wifi (now greatly improved but still has it's bad days). The restaurant provides a good quality of food despite being a buffet in addition to the snack menu. The quality of finishing in the rooms still could be improved but I understand they are being upgraded slowly. One thing that is very good are the new very comfortable beds I always have a great sleep on them.

Breakfast is good, although I felt some of the hot dishes could be hotter. The fruit is great, as was the bread and pastries.   Not used the pool, but this can be seen from the bar and looks clean and well kept.   The staff I have dealt with have always been polite and efficient.

Very good in a difficult environment.,"A wonderful recluse from the noise outside! I've stayed in several places around Lagos but the Ibis is the one that you can rely on. Lagos is unpredictable and totally different from any other place I've been, I realised that pretty quickly. It is important to think about this before writing a review. The hotel is very comfortable, the staff are very friendly, the pool is wonderful and the hotel grounds are immaculate. The hotel manager makes you feel welcome, he takes the time to come and have a chat and even remembers your name! Anywhere you stay in Lagos you will have problems. It just depends on how quickly they are addressed! The Ibis was very good from my experience.  Thank you Richard.",June 2013,,,wrote a review Jun 2013,york,['1 contribution'],50,[]

Horrible,This hotel is over priced and not well maintained. I travel for a living and I have never stayed at a hotel that does not provide wash cloths or hand towels.  In the bathroom there was a hole  between the door and the base of the shower. The beds are a very thin form pad on a wood panel board. The television is a 13 inch flat screen that needs to be a Childs room.  A CRUISE SHIP ROOM IS BIGGER THAN THIS! This hotel should not have been rated as a 4 star. The online pictures of this facility is no where close to reality. My personal belongings has been stolen and reported to the manager and nothing has been done. I will never recommend this Hotel chain to anyone.,April 2013,,,wrote a review Apr 2013,"Charleston, South Carolina, USA",['1 contribution'],10,[]
Good to stay,"I am just staying in Ibis Airport and I will check in next time again. Main reason is location ( close to Airport ) and price / value based on Nigerian level. Rooms are small but not too small, breakfirst very good compared to other hotels in Nigeria, lunch / dinner availabe. Some points to improve: No save in the room, the matress in my room is not the newest ( means, hollow in the middle ) and the snacks in the bar could be little more healty ;-).

be careful!,"Before you reach the Ibis Hotel from the airport you will pass the Ibis Royal literally before you turn right to the Ibis.  The Ibis Royal is a local hotel with vaguely similar graphics that can fool you in the dark and if you're tired ( at no other time however).

OK...But......,"As I was used to the standard of Ibis in the UK, I was frankly not expecting anything lesser even though it can be a tricky expectation as this is Nigeria.

Same with the bed sheets as well as the pillow cases. Please do not ask how I got to know.  2. For God sake, help with the room service, and in the least with the Coffee / Tea stuff.

A pleasant stay,I chose to stay at this hotel after seeing a review in Tripadvisor.  The hotel is located very near to the airport and is a most pleasant place to stay after a late night flight into Lagos.  The hotel is very good value for money in terms of hotels in Lagos which are generally to say the least expensive.  The service was good.  There was a breakfast included in the price which was most pleasant.  There is also a nice pool at the hotel.    The rooms are basic but they are clearn and comfortable.

Perfect Location & Great Experience,"The Ibis Lagos Airport hotel has a great location. It is just couple of minutes away from the airport.

Anyway, the room is just to sleep as outside there is a beautiful pool just waiting for you to jump in.    The hotel also has a restaurant for breakfast and dinner offering a buffet style service.

"Opinion/Views about Ibis Hotel at Lagos, Nigeria","I am a frequent user of this hotel. The location, staff, break fast, and general facility are great. However, here are three major things, in my opinion, that need to be urgently attended to help improve the experience at Ibis Hotel at Airport Road, Lagos. (1) There should be an electric outlet in the bathroom for those who use electric shavers, hair dryer, etc. (2) There should be a small personal refrigerator in each room. (3)  I'm not sure how this could be solved, but the size of the room is way too small for a couple to stay in. As a compromise, since nothing could be done to solve this problem, couples should be allowed complimentary breakfast for the price of single occupant.   I hope my opinion means something to the management of Ibis. Thanks.",December 2012,,,wrote a review Jan 2013,"Baltimore, Maryland, USA",['1 contribution'],30,[]

My preferred hotel in Lagos when combining price and quality,"I've travelled to Lagos off and on since 2005.  Finding a place that is good value, convenient and a reasonable standard is not easy.  I've to stayed at the Four Points Sheraton but wanted a less-expensive option, closer to the airport.  I found the Ibis on-line and wasn't sure what to expect.  I stayed at Ibis twice during my recent trip to Lagos.  I had good experiences both time.  Yes, the rooms are small, but the public areas on the main floors are big and pleasant; I was able to get some work done in them.  The food is good. The service is excellent: I had trouble with the Internet (it was so slow), told the manager and he called the hotel's Internet service provider and had the Bandwidth increased.

"Very nice hotel cheaper and much cheaper than some other ""western"" hotels in Lagos!","I think the Ibis was a very nice hotel.  I would definitely recommend it and will likely stay there again.  It's along the lines of  Hampton Inn for Americans reading this review.  The two meals I ate at the hotel were very good.  The evening buffet is mostly Nigerian food....I would have preferred more ""western"" choices....but it was good.  Service in all aspects of the hotel was very good.  One word of warning.....when visiting this hotel for the first time, do not get it confused with another hotel with Ibis in it's name which was just a few buildings down.

IBIS Airport Road,Excellent stay with easy access to international and local airports.  Breakfast buffett was very good although with a breakfast window of 4 to 11 a.m needed refreshing quite frequently.  Staff very pleasant and friendly.

Not Bad at all.,"I checked into Ibis hotel, Airport road, Ikeja, Lagos.  The hotel is quite clean, very well located within Lagos, at least for the travellers heading out of town.  The breakfast is quite good, other meas are also fair enough in taste and quality. The facilities are nice and the rooms are quite clean, but a bit on the small side ( comparatively). It is quite a simple and functional hotel,  especially if it is used as a layover spot for a trip.  However, the internet services in the rooms are nit satisfactory and most times, you would need to come down to the lobby to use it effectively ( including right now that I am sending this trip advise)  Thanks  Gbulasilgba.",April 2012,,,wrote a review Apr 2012,"Lagos, Nigeria","['26 contributions', '17 helpful votes']",30,[]

Very good value in an overpriced town,"Lagos is ridiculously overpriced for hotels, so we decided to stay at this hotel near the airport. It was very close to both terminals, clean, and served bar food through the night (which was a relief, as we had flown non-stop from New Zealand, so were very confused about what time it was!), Staff were friendly, the pool was clean and the buffet breakfast was fantastic.

"Good value, clean and comfortable hotel","The hotel is nothing spectacular but for those travellers that require accomodation close to the airport this is one to consider. The hotel itself was clean, tidy and secure, with a walled compound and security guards on the gate.  I didn't get to use the pool, but it looked well maintained.  The food is nothing to set the world on fire, but it's ok. There is a reasonable choice at the breakfast buffet, and there is an evening buffet (which I did not try). There are bar snacks available too.  I was there on business, and with my colleague had a comfortable stay.

Best place close to Lagos Airport,IBIS Hotel Lagos Airport.  Ibis hotel near Lagos airport is ideal hotel if you have early morning flights or late evening flight as traffic is is horrendous to & from Lagos/ Victoria Island/ Ikoyi areas. The hotel is a secured location with small sized rooms with a place to dine / have  drink. The menu is overall smallish. The hotel is very functional and is ideal if you are in town for a day or 2. Its close to the airport so u will definitely not miss your flight. In lagos people usually start 3 pm from their hotels for an 11 pm flight due traffic issues. I would suggest this hotel to anyone who is transiting through Lagos and has some time at hand as the airport does not have any facilities to even sit.

OK for a night avoid for longer stays,"This hotel is located about 10 mins for the airport.

During my 5 night stay I never had hot water, other guests also had the same problem. The TV is my room had a random selection of channels which would change each day. Food choice is very limited.

Surely meets a crucial need.,"In the vicinity of Lagos airport there were few choices... The new Ibis, just 10 mins down the Airport Road going towards the city, provides a desperately needed option. Mind you, this is a basic no-frills budget hotel. But offers all that you would need for a safe, comfortable break.   Checkin was fast. Staff are friendly and eager. Rooms are standard Ibis but did seem to be a couple of feet smaller than usual Ibis rooms. One disappointment was the absence of complimentary tea-service in the room. Most Ibis hotels offer that.
