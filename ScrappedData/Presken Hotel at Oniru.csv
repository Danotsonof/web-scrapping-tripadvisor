A very sad visit,"I lodged into the hotel on Thursday and i was to check out on Sunday morning. Let me start by talking about their workers..Especially the restaurant and the bar. I remember ordering two bottles of water and till now...The particular person that attended to me refused to give me my change. I called the reception regarding this issue and all she said was that theres nothing she can do about it. The hotel food was wack and salty.I had to go out to eat or order food from vendors. The bathroom was blocked.When i have my bath, everywhere becomes flooded.Water cannot go through the drainage.It was so sad. The workers dont call you if you'll be needing complimentary breakfast..If you dont call the kitchen, they wont serve you. And even when they serve you, they dont give you eating",July 2022,,,wrote a review Jul 2022,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",10,"['Cleanliness bubble_10', 'Service bubble_10', 'Sleep Quality bubble_10']"
