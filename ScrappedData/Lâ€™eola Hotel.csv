IMPRESSED,"I was very impressed with Leola. I searched for top-rated hotels in Ikeja area and it came up. The name did not impress me, but the pictures did. Then what I met there impressed me further.  The place is neat. Bathroom is clean. The only minus in my shower is the white silicone at the corners of the shower. It could have been done better, or use grey cement for perfection. I like the comfort of the place.",July 2022,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Jul 2022,"Ibadan, Nigeria","['39 contributions', '37 helpful votes']",50,[]
Nice Boutique Hotel,"I was pleasantly surprised with the positive staff attitude, amenities available in the hotel and tasty meals all available at a fantastic rate.

"Great hotel, with awesome staff","Had an amazing stay. Everything worked great. Mini pool and mini gym to complement it. Breakfast was tasty with a decent variety. Although I had a nasty experience where I ordered for dinner, a spaghetti bolognese meal, where the meat was rotten :-( any cook can tell if food has gone bad but for it to have been served to me, made me question the food in store and played it safe by eating elsewhere after that experience. Aside that Wifi worked well. The frequent power cuts were not felt as a generator kicked in a few seconds after the mains went off. Overall I Enjoyed my stay but very disturbed by the food experience. May be a one-off but just be mindful",December 2019,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Dec 2019,"Lome, Togo","['3 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50']"

Breakfast pastries tasted like they were made just for you,"Let me start by raving about the breakfast pastries (croissant, banana bread, scone and pain aux raisins). All wonderfully delicate and fresh. They seemed to have been prepared by someone's mom who also happens to be an expert chef, wanting to send her children into the day with a special ""I love you"".  The art in the reception area created a great environment. Definitely worthwhile to linger and admire.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.

"Best Internet I have encountered in Nigeria, Amazing Food and Guaranteed good night sleep","L'eola impresses me more everytime I spend time here. The 3 nights spent here did not serve up any dull moments. The internet is so fast and reliable, I just settle in and watch my series on Netflix. The food options are also impressive and leave me looking forward to dinner time. As for sleep, the pillows are super soft and the bed so comfortable. The only concern I had was with the water pressure up on the second floor, and I like the speed with which the maintenance guy was dispatched to come and fix it.

Nice & stylish hotel in Ikeja,"Have been looking for a not overcrowded and nice hotel close to the airport.

"Change of name, brand is even better","The hotel (formerly known as Protea Leadway) and very much still a part of the Leadway groups had actually stepped up from the last time I visited. The food is still great and the quality of sleep is rated high. There's also high speed internet and an ATM in the lobby. Complimentary breakfast with lots of TV stations to choose from. The location of the hotel is also a big plus as the Airport can easily be accessed from the Hotel and for someone who needs to transact business on the mainland or even quickly link up with the Island, this is value for money. A shower curtain has also been put at the entrance of the bathroom which provides some feeling of privacy and means that families with children can consider the hotel. A door would ultimately see the rating go up to 5/5",March 2019,,,wrote a review Mar 2019,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria","['724 contributions', '26 helpful votes']",40,[]
Hospitality meets friendly...what a powerful combination!,"This is a hidden gem. The welcome is indicative of the warm and friendly personality of the entire team at this hotel. Their attention to detail is meticulous and they are always there when you need them, and they are not there when they are not needed.

Satisfying Stay in Lagos,"Came for a quick trip to Nigeria; glad to have had my first hotel stay in Nigeria at Leadway. I was impressed with the professional and courteous staff; the facility felt secure, which was important for me; and the room was comfortable--good for a solo traveler.

A comfortable and secure stay in Lagos,"I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions for business and have always found it to be a good choice. Rooms are comfortable and large with a great bathroom and storage for clothing. Rooms also have their own desk and phone for working which is great. The lounge area is comfortable with a range of sofas chairs and dining tables and the food is good. The menu has some Nigerian food dishes as well as Italian options (pasta and pizza) and some healthy options like salmon and chicken. After multiple stays, the menu does (as with anywhere) start to get a little repetitive but I only felt this way on my 5th stay. One suggestion I would have is for Leadway Hotel to add more options for starters or light options for lunch as well as more vegetarian options in general.

An island in the middle of a very busy city!,"The hotel is relatively close to the airport, which is a major plus considering the traffic conditions in Nairobi!! The hotel is small but very cosy, the rooms are nicely decorated and have a wonderful open bathroom (room and bathroom were separated only by a curtain). The small but nice outdoor swimmingpool is a perfect place to relax (a little bit small if you want to swim). The gym is also small (but it's ok; as the hotel is having only a few rooms) but has a new trademill and stepper as well as some machines and free weights.

Nice hotel,"The hotel was actually up to standard. I give it a solid B. So I'd stay again biggest put off was the smell of smoking coming from someone's room. The outside is a little deceiving but the inside is up to your the US Courtyard Marriott standard. The only real big issue with this hotel is the cost of the hotel. If it was ~$75-85 less it would get 5 stars. At their rate id expect a Hyatt Regency type hotel.  But for Lagos I will say it's good, strong B grading. Maybe some perks they can add is free hotel pick up and drop off and local rate for food for hotel guest. This would make it an A hotel.

All class,I travel often and this hotel is my choice when I'm in Lagos.Well run hotel. Friendly and professional staff. The social area is always clean and well maintained. Rooms are clean and well equipped. The dÃ©cor ranks up there with the best of them. Staying in hotels is not always about appearances and although it plays a big roll.

"Exquisite, cosy and serene hotel","If you want to hide from the hustle and bustle of Lagos, this is the hotel to be. Tucked in a side street off ikeja, the hotel, though medium sized is well designed. I loved the brick wall that separated the bathroom from the main room, I love hotels that pay attention to details and they definitely did with a bar of chocolate waiting on my bed and a personal note with my name on it. The only minus was that the electric socket on the walls was south African, which we don't use in Nigeria. Luckily, I had recently returned from joburg so I used one of the adaptors I bought.

Nice surprise,"In over 25 years of my traveling experience I can say, I have seen most of it. This hotel was booked for me by 3rd party and I did not have any expectation whatsoever. But I must say, beyond my dreams I was surprised in positive way. Room was excellent, equipped both with shower and bath tub. Whole room was nice and clean. Restaurant works late in the night and opens 5 AM so if you need to go for early flight you are still able to have some food before you leave. Wi-Fi was actually available as they said so, all around. If I must to point at something, this would be service in restaurant, I came late and there was not so many people at all, but service was slow, though food was nice.

Beware the front desk!,"I agree with the consensus sentiment: this hotel generally exceeds expectations. It's not a five-star, to be sure, but the facilities are surprisingly good. The standard King I stayed in was clean and well laid out. The location, for a business hotel, was good: close to the airport in busy Ikeja but nestled in a quiet street off the main road. But first you have to make it past the front desk, and be advised to hold on to your wallet!   In the worst Nigerian fashion (I am Nigerian, by the way) the front desk staff attempted to profit off me. At check-in on late evening of Apr 16, they tried to renounce a confirmed booking I made on a third-party website, claiming they were fully booked -- even though I'd called an hour prior to arrival to confirm availability.

Little bubble of peace,"I stayed here in January 2015 while I was in Lagos on business. This is a great little hotel, cool, calm, peaceful. Has everything you'd want. Really relaxing if you've been out in the city all day. All very clean and safe. Staff are friendly but not OTT. The lady who'd handled my booking came out from the office to meet me when I checked in, it felt like a little family run place where all the guests are really appreciated.    The only thing I'd mention - and it's not a negative at all, just something I hadn't realised - is how very small the hotel is. There's only one restaurant, which serves the same menu for lunch and dinner, so the food can get a bit monotonous if you're there for a few days. The food is very good though.

Obviously,  it was their first time of lodging there.  You cannot miss the impressive bookshelf at the Check-In counter. I have not seen it's kind in Nigeria. The room is spacious and the bath tub and bathroom area is unique. It was my first time of visiting the pool area. The ambience in the evening is cool and calm.

They all had a smile when wishing you or greeting you whenever they saw you around the premises. The hotel may not claim to be very big with numerous restaurants, but they do an excellent job with what they have. The breakfast was just what you would expect in the morning.

Business Stay,"Single night stay between flights.  A small comfortable hotel near the airport with friendly, helpful staff and a nice bar/restaurant.  Food is good, particularly the Hamburger!  The small pool is clean and inviting. Gym is small with limited equipment and a little too humid.  Room was clean and quite comfortable.  Bath room a little tired but perfectly acceptable.

Cozy...just like home,"By mere chance or fate, we had to leave Cairo for home (Nigeria rather than Dubai as this was our planned destination for Christmas holidays) and wanted to try another hotel rather than Southern sun and most importantly wanted to stay centrally on the mainland. So Protea Hotel leadway was the choice for me.  Where do i start?  Booking process? - Seamless, thanks to Idowu Egbo (the reservation manager, i guess)  Check-in? Remarkably fast and virtually flawless.   The room? - African touch blended with modern features.   Ambiance? - Its a small hotel with a very pleasant ambiance. The Christmas decorations added a very homely feel  Staffs? - All smiles (real smiles not forced ones) and everyone ready to help make your stay as pleasant as possible.

An Hotel with African Touch,"It was a weekend stay with family for a break and it was value for money, I must confess though. Location is slightly removed tucked in an residential estate away from the noise pollution associated with typical Lagos environment, and security was excellent. Facilities in and around the rooms are just average though the claim of 'fast' internet service was a mirage but it could be claimed on the environment. Its a place to recommend to friends who won't mind paying for good service",June 2013,,,wrote a review Sep 2013,"Lagos, Nigeria","['44 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",40,[]

"THE place to be, in Lagos","It might be boring to read, but in the past, when one stayed in Lagos, there was one hotel on the mainland and one on the islands. That is, internationally acceptable, hotels. Well they were and are exhorbitant expenisive and though renovated etc. still quite hopeless, especially the Libanese/state run Eko. Now a few more hotels have come up, quite a few to say all.  Of the RSA Protea group, there is ( in Lagos) the Ikeya one, which is OK, the VI one ( Victoria  island) , which is terrible, and badly run by a combination of Protea and owners management ( the worst), there is another one on VI ( Kuramo), well hidden but also always full, and the Westwood, but do not like the locatrion,as well as the one in Lekki, but that is any way to avoid because of teh Lekki Jam.

Great hotel in Lagos!,"I recently had to travel to Lagos, Nigeria on business and was shocked at the prices of hotels in this city. I found the Protea Hotel Leadway online and the Tripadvisor reviews seemed good so I booked it.  I was very impressed - the security, the room, the bathroom, the free high speed wifi and the quality of restaurant food were all excellent. The staff were very friendly and accommodating - from the breakfast chef who asked me every morning if I had a good sleep to the duty manager that went out of his way to accommodate me when I needed some help. Lagos has huge electricity shortages so life runs on generators - fortunately they are very good at the hotel and despite a few seconds of blackout now and then you wouldn't even notice.   Ikeja is out of the ""downtown"" city which I",July 2011,,,wrote a review Jul 2011,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['32 contributions', '51 helpful votes']",50,[]

Watch for hidden charges!,"Hotel quality was fine, but be careful of the hidden charges. We were charged an extra night because we checked in before 2pm!!! Even the duty manager refused to compromise. Our laundry took 48 hours and a lot of chasing to get back on a ""Same day service"". No hot water on the first day. The cost of food and drinks are horrendous. A bottle of water was N 800 (about 3.2 British pounds)",October 2009,,,wrote a review Oct 2009,England,"['85 contributions', '68 helpful votes']",20,[]

"It's not great, but it's the best there is","You don't (unless you are a masochist) go to Nigeria as a tourist. If you're here, you have a reason to be here and you are prepared to put up with the discomfort, the ugliness and all the other problems. So, if you have to be here, where do you stay? All the hotels in Lagos are overpriced by world standards and none of them is special. The Protea Leadway is the best of the bunch. The rooms are comfortable and clean (no bugs). The menu is limited but not bad. The service is friendly and as professional as you would expect from Protea trained staff. Security (very important in Lagos) is very good. Take lots of small denomination US dollar bills -- they're accepted with delight as tips and if you take any leftover Nigerian currency out of the country it will be worthless -- you",April 2009,,,wrote a review Apr 2009,"Shropshire, England","['155 contributions', '120 helpful votes']",30,[]
Can't go wrong,"Currently staying at the Portea, leaving tomorrow.  Had a pretty confusing time selecting the right hotel in Lagos.  The reviews however, definitely helped.  Hence, writing my own. Have stayed at the Sheraton and the Victoria crown plaza before, but this hotel is so much better than these other over-rated hotels.  A little over-priced for Lagos, but still cheaper than most of the competitors. Very secure.  Great service.  From the security guard outside, all the way up to the manager, the staff is extremely personable and helpful.  The manager, a South African lady, went out of her way to arrange an excursion for me.   The breakfast buffet is decent.  Nothing extravagant, but very clean and reasonably choiced.   Rooms are very nice.  If anyone has stayed at the 987 Prague, the",October 2008,,,wrote a review Oct 2008,Karachi,"['1 contribution', '3 helpful votes']",50,[]
Loving it at Leadway,"I have travelled to Nigeria several times on business since 2005.  In the past I have stayed at the Protea Oakwood Park on the Lekki Peninsula.  However, this trip a colleague and I were just spending a couple of nights in Lagos on our way to/from Liberia, so we were looking for a nice, secure, comfortable hotel near the airport.  I had heard that Protea had a new hotel near the Sheraton, not too far from the airport, so we decided to give it a try.  we were definitely impressed with the quality boutique style hotel.  Unlike the larger Sheraton, the Protea Leadway is a 30plus room hotel with cozy restaurant bar with quality amenities, the rooms are all beautifully designed and some of the nicest amenities I have seen in West African hotels (hardwood floors, marble, flat screen",May 2008,,,wrote a review May 2008,Southern California,"['37 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",50,[]

Lagos Mainland now has 5 star accomodation !!,"I have been travelling to Lagos, Nigeria for many years. Until now, one of the few options on the mainland of Lagos has been the Sheraton Hotel. Unfortunately the Sheraton (and Eko on Victoria Island) have outrageous rooms rates and give little in return. It is sad to see that little or none of the revenue from these two hotels is put back into the business.   I was thrilled this week to discover a brand new hotel (2 months old) near the Sheraton. It is the Protea Leadway in Maryland, Lagos. This hotel would not be out of place in cities such as London and it deserves 5 stars. Those 5 stars are earned by   - reasonable rates - high calibre of staff who are attentive and pleasant to deal with - good menu and restaurant - quiet location - first class facilities and rooms - smaller",September 2007,,,wrote a review Sep 2007,London,"['2 contributions', '13 helpful votes']",50,[]
