Absolutely Fabulous,"I love this hotel.  We stayed here for 18nights, family of 4, two rooms connecting doors lets start with the positive: Staff very friendly and professional, Rooms were spacious and clean, Security fantastic, location perfect, Loved breakfast especially the fried stew and Yam. WiFi was fast and stable enough to watch YouTube. Food in the hotel was reasonable priced and tasty. The Swimming pool and Gym was kept clean  The Chairman was quite Friendly, My husband spoke to him couple of times in the hotel.  You can also play table tennis on hotel premises.  Now the negatives, being very picking here but would have loved a bit more variety for breakfast (local food).   I will definitely recommend this hotel, my kids loved the swimming pool and I will surely come here again",August 2021,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Sep 2021,,"['19 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]

14 days at regent,"The hotel was neat and very quiet. The staffs are great, from Austin the Housekeeper to the front manager Akin everybody were great. The only suggestions from me, is that when there are two people in the room there should be at least enough pillows for them. It took me 4 days to have an extra pillow. The coffee cups should be  two instead of one for two people to share. Overall a great hotel. Would be glad to recommend to others.",November 2018,Traveled as a couple,Easy to move around.

Customer Service at it's Best!!,"We had an amazing 7 night stay at the Regent. Offering spacious, clean and extremely comfortable suites within a conveniently located hotel, The Regent offers great value accommodation. It is also very safe and secure, with 24 hour security. Above all, the best thing about The Regent is it’s staff. They are simply excellent! Extremely professional, yet very friendly and personable, the staff were attentive to all our needs. They have the unique gift to make each guest feel special and valued. If I had any constructive criticism to make, it would be that the breakfast could be a little more extensive in choice and range and should include a Nigerian option. That said, when we asked for fried plantain and egg stew, they were more than happy to make it for us. We will definitely",October 2018,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Oct 2018,"London, United Kingdom",['1 contribution'],50,"['Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
Not Meeting Expectation,Spent time at The Regent recently as I needed a place close to the International Airport in Lagos. I had visited a guest at the facility before and had been taken by its ambience and spacious rooms. I was very disappointed with the very bare services and the staff attitude.,August 2018,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Aug 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria","['95 contributions', '39 helpful votes']",30,[]

"Great service, very welcoming and helpful staff.","Nice comfortable hotel. Central and convenient location. Spacious, clean, with a swimming pool area at the back. All the staff were very welcoming, helpful and friendly. The food at the hotel restaurant was very tasty. The only downside was the wi-fi kept cutting out, and because there is a school on one side and the generator on the other, it was a bit noisy at times.

reasonable place near airport,"The services, for Nigeria, were pretty good. Clean, pretty quiet. Staff was pleasant, but inflexible. I arrived at 9am from Kaduna, and was to fly out at 10:30pm, so was there only a day. But when I asked if I could get my breakfast the first day rather than the second, they refused. Said management wouldn't allow them to. But they also wouldn't let me talk to management.

Comfortable and welcoming,"I'm always happy to stay at the Regent, located in Ikeja, as its a friendly small hotel with staff that are incredibly happy to help you with whatever need you may have.   Rooms are a decent size and have comfortable beds. Decor and furniture are modern. Big bar area for relaxation or discussing work with colleagues.   The lunch/dinner menu is excellent - especially the fish. Breakfast choices are the same every day and there's not a great amount of choice.  Used the on site gym a couple of times - could do with more efficient aircon - although I didn't give it all that much time to cool down.",February 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2017,"Epsom, United Kingdom","['1121 contributions', '470 helpful votes']",40,"['Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"

Great location and very good service.,"Off Mobalaji Bank Anthony Way and to Isaac John street, the hotel is situated in the cool heart of Ikeja GRA.  Good restaurants litter the area and you are never too far from a good plate outside of the walls of the hotel.  Very clean and neat rooms, the staff are also very warm and friendly.

Loved the Hotel and enjoyed my stay,"Shame about KaffyMaffy experience and happy it is resolved because I thought it was a really nice hotel for the price.  The reception staff were most welcoming and the rooms were big, comfortable and clean.   They are also very receptive to feedback. The air conditioning worked superbly and WiFi was excellent. My niece did a block booking for her wedding guests in September 2016.  I enjoyed my stay there and consequently booked to stay there again on my way out of Nigeria back to England.  Tried only their Nigerian dishes and they were good. They could probably improve their breakfast selection a little bit more.  I would definitely not hesitate to book the hotel again. If you want a good and not too expensive hotel within easy reach of both the local and International airports",September 2016,,,wrote a review Nov 2016,,"['4 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]
Enjoyed my stay,"The rooms are very spacious and the decor is great.Lift is a bit small, and parking is limited.The complimentary breakfast had little variety though. Staff were friendly and helpful.

Problem Resolved courtesy of manager,"Previous posting Via Kaffy/Maffy has now been resolved Overall this is a good safe and secure hotel. The manager has acted quickly and efficiently. My initial comments were as a result of shock and anger on the day. So in hindsight, I would not let this incident prevent me from staying here again.

Robbery from my room,"Lost a very expensive Polo shirt in laundry, tried to fob me off with a cheap look alike. On final day had £100 stolen from my wallet whilst at breakfast- used every excuse under the sun to delay, despite me asking for the manager and the Police, knowing I had to leave for my flight!- luckily our Distributor was at hand- await outcome. despite assurances, still waiting for my Polo to be returned and of course my money FAT CHANCE!!!! beware this establishment.",February 2016,,,wrote a review Mar 2016,"England, United Kingdom","['4 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",10,[]
"Nice spacious rooms, very comfortable beds and excellent 4G internet connection","Rooms are large and comfortable and the bathrooms -  shower and bath well finished and quite luxurious. Good reliable internet connection, reasonable TV with some of the DSTV sports channels and a couple of good movie channels.  The restaurant is rather stark and soul-less and strangely to get the very nice infinity pool beside which you can have drinks you have to walk through the restaurant. Next to the pool is a reasonably well equipped gym but staff seem to be missing and it seems rarely used.  Despite the restaurant location, breakfast is OK (order the Spanish omelette) and they have expresso coffee which is a bonus (at a price!). Overall the menu is good and the food well cooked and tasty.

Money for bacon,"The Regent Luxury Suites are not luxurious, they are average. I was not very happy with my stay here. But instead of moving to another hotel, I thought ""how bad can three nights be""? Well, it was pretty average. I think they tried to attain the illusion of minimalism, but only succeeded in looking bare. The room was small and has little amenities. They removed my soap without replacing it on day one. Second day I didn't get any water to drink. Didn't replace the tea I drank. Showered cold one night, the next night they fixed it. Kept losing WiFi signal. But the worst was breakfast. You get bread, yogurt, a few fruit, cereal, juice, coffee and eggs made separately (you have to decide quite quickly on this or your waitress walks away). I asked if they have any bacon, and they said",August 2015,,,wrote a review Aug 2015,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['233 contributions', '31 helpful votes']",20,[]
"Fast Internet, Friendly staff!","The staff is friendly and eager to help you with your needs. The internet service is very fast and free ! The food that I ordered was great so not sure if the hotel has a new kitchen staff based on other poor reviews on the food; however, I waited for over an hour for its delivery to my room.  the bathroom amenities are lacking, and towels looked dirty and old. The TV is too small for the size of the room . These are minor issues but this is definitely not a 4 star hotel and for the price of the room I expected way more. also no Iron or ironing board so bring your own if you need one.  Security is tight and i will definitely stay here again when in Lagos",February 2015,,,wrote a review Feb 2015,,"['2 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",30,[]
Average Hotel for Business travellers,"Verymuch of an average business community hotel with basic facilities. Rooms were better compared to hotels of same category, but lacks attractions. Reasonable in security arrangements, cleanliness and quiteness, but affected by limited choice of food, liveliness, ultra small swiming pool and long delays in ""Room Service"".  Recomends for nothing other than short business travels.",August 2014,,,wrote a review Nov 2014,"Kelaniya, Sri Lanka","['367 contributions', '127 helpful votes']",30,[]
disappointing,"The Regent is just ok. Average. For the price (N45k standard room), it's actually poor - price doesn't match value. Room service was poor, waited over an hour for pepper soup and fries. In room items were not there - no bottled water, two empty tissue boxes. The towels looked dirty/used - possibly just stained, but those should be replaced. Hot water in shower lasted a total of 6 minutes. Finally - the complimentary breakfast: slices of bread, cheap buns, 2 types of cereal, sliced up fruit, eggs. That's the buffet. The beginning and the end. Room service food prices are decent.  One positive: the internet is quite fast and I experienced no down time.",August 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,"Abuja, Nigeria","['27 contributions', '31 helpful votes']",30,[]
Useful business location close to airport,"The Regent in Ikeja, Lagos is very conveniently located, close to the airport, but rather far from Victoria Island and Lagos Island, the economic centres of Lagos. With good security and reasonable facilities, it is a useful stop-over if travelling via Lagos to other Nigerian locations or if you need a stay close to the airport. Although using it as a local transfer location overnight between an inward international flight and a domestic departure, I also used the Regent to host a business dinner for 8 business acquaintances. The hotel was very receptive when I made a dinner reservation, on arrival, the food and beverage manager came out to meet me and to check on any specific requirements and overall, the staff were great. I would have no reservation in hosting another dinner",June 2014,,,wrote a review Jun 2014,"Bromsgrove, United Kingdom","['212 contributions', '97 helpful votes']",30,[]
Overbooked,"Regrettably the Regent was overbooked when we arrived at about 10pm and one of our party of three was sent to the nearby Sheraton. There however nobody had heard of him. He returned about an hour later and still got a room at the Regent, perhaps therewith again bumping someone else.  Having said this, to Nigerian standards this is a new and quite nice hotel, with good value for money for this quality in Lagos. It is fairly close to the airport which is good for overnight stays.  My rating of 3 therefore the average of 1 for being overbooked and 5 for overall hotel quality.",February 2014,,,wrote a review Feb 2014,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","['20081 contributions', '73982 helpful votes']",30,[]
Great place to be,One of the best around Ikeja axis.

There's simply no other choice in Ikeja.,"While I find the price incredibly expensive at $300 a night for what is a 4 star hotel at best, I'll unfortunately have to return if I need to work on the Lagos mainland.  The advantage is that its convenietly close to the any of the airports, rooms are very clean, spacious and with high ceilings which makes it feel even bigger and The staff are courteous.   The downs are the cost of rooms, it shouldnt be more than $200 in my opinion but Lagos is an insane city for room rates, food and drinks are expensive and not exactly tasty but options are available just a short walk from the hotel.   Until there are cheaper options in the same class, I'll say the regent is an unavoidable choice.

All you need but great food,"Lagos is expensive and often is outrageously pricy. I remember paying $450 per night at the run down Sheraton in Ikeja 4 years ago. And then I didn't have much choice. Luckily, the city is changing and now there are more options which has obvious implications on rates but also stimulate quality. Regent in Ikeja is one of them. If your business is on mainland it offers reasonable quality for reasonable money. For as much as $170, you will find yourself in a spacious, well designed room with wifi at no extra charge and dsat tv. The staff is friendly and reacts very quickly to guests' requests and they all speak proper English (those who have been to Nigeria know how difficult to understand the locals' strong accent). One thing which is not exactly up to expectations is their food.",November 2012,,,wrote a review Nov 2012,"Zanzibar Island, Tanzania","['98 contributions', '41 helpful votes']",40,[]

nice place,"spent last week 4 nights in The Regent, and must admit my colleague and myself were surprised with the hotel. very friendly and especially helpful staff. food is pretty much OK, enough choice and great fresh fish.. since it's a small hotel, the bar and dining room are empty most of the time. this means that you don't have to wait long for your food, but it's quit boring at night. not the warm and special African feeling..  rooms very OK, and very neat and clean.. enough hot water to shower, and no noise at night in the corridors.. plenty of seats around the swimming pool area.  good place to stay when you're in Lagos, and probably the best price/quality you may find in that city..  not as lively as Sheraton, but great staff..  this will be my hotel when staying in Lagos from now",October 2012,,,wrote a review Oct 2012,"Accra, Ghana","['11 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",40,[]

Shower can be a bit of a trial to use...directions would help. View...construction site. Breakfast...very basic and really needs to be worked upon.

Decent for Lagos,"Lagos hotels are not known for value-for-money and fortunately this place fit the company budget for an extended business stay. The room was clean, since the hotel is new, and fairly spacious. The TV could offer more choice; 5 channels got pretty boring after a while. The WiFi was acceptable and free. The gym was very basic. Breakfast was dismal and despite talking to the restaurant manager about offering more choice and receiving promises that it would improve, nothing happened. There are a couple of decent restaurants within walking distance although each time I walked out onto the filthy Lagos street I wanted to return to my room immediately.

Comfortable rooms but dreadful food,"Having stayed a number of times in the ghastly Sheraton Hotel I was looking forward to staying at the new Regent Hotel. The website looked promising and the close proximity to the airport was a plus. The hotel is a mixture of the not too bad and the truly awful. I was staying for a 4 day conference and due to security concerns was more or less trapped there the whole time.  So first the good. The hotel was by and large clean and tidy. Not something that can be said for the Sheraton. The hotel staff were willing and helpful although there lack of training really showed in the quality of service - in any Asian hotel these staff would not last 5 minutes. My room was large and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was clean and bright, the water was hot and the shower powerful.
