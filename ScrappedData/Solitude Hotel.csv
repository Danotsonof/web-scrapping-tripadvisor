A good hotel turned bad!,I was at Solitude Hotel in January 2018 and the facilities were completely run down. Service was sloppy. The common areas were unkempt.   I came in for my usual big prawns but even the quality of cooking was poor. So were the waiters. They were not even engaging.,January 2018,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Apr 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria","['21 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",30,[]
6 Nights in a row.,It was in early 2015 that I went to Lagos for business and I stayed in this hotel all the time. The rooms are clean but has that extremely strong room refreshner everywhere from room to corridor to lobby. The breakfast was plain and simple ... Nothing as buffet or such. The bar area has what is needed . From local information to drinks of most kinds.  Security is high and it's a budget friendly hotel.,February 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jan 2018,"Changsha, China","['125 contributions', '41 helpful votes']",40,[]
A Good and Lovely Budget Hotel,"We stayed in Solitude Hotel & Spa two different times in 2015(Feb and Dec) and it is a place we will go back to again and again. It is clean and the staff are quite welcoming and very helpful and efficient. The breakfast is ok and the ambience is good too. It is very well located and close to many business places, great restaurants and a large mall. It is a very good budget hotel.",December 2015,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Feb 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['20 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",40,[]
Lourdes kindness pilgrimsge,Just back from Lourdes and as always had the pleasure of staying in the solitude hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel for either business or pleasure . The staff are friendly and efficient. The food is by far the best in this hotel than any other I have stayed in. They cater to all tastes and cultures and their restaurant is one of the few in Lourdes that has room for wheelchairs without disturbing other diners. We have stayed many times in this hotel and have never had a problem in it that could not be solved. The manager Francois and his reception staff are highly efficient and professional but also welcoming and friendly and always easy to deal with. The bar staff are great especially Christine and Jean the managers and Frederic and Jean Claude who are look after all,February 2015,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2015,"Dublin, Ireland","['8 contributions', '34 helpful votes']",50,[]
Extraordinarily Clean Rooms,Their rooms are outstanding in terms of cleanliness. Their beds are well spread with sparkling brand new sheets. You cannot fault them.

Excellent and Outstanding,"â€¢	This remains my favorite hotel for business,research and relaxation purposes in Lagos. The location allows you to quickly be on your way to business and in the night the various restaurants around in the area are just a 5 minute taxi ride away! Unless you fancy Pat's bar a lot,it is just a stone throw and very close to oniru private beach.",May 2013,Traveled solo,Rooms on the south side are quieter,wrote a review Jun 2013,"Lagos, Nigeria","['7 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_50', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
