Basic,"Spent two nights there and it was just okay. When you book online, remember you may be charged differently on arrival because they calculate using their current dollar rate.  They were kind to upgrade our room as first time visitors. Room was clean and conducive even though the bathroom tap was faulty (informed them but they said they couldn't fix it during our stay) ""English breakfast"" was super basic (2slices of bread,omelette,sausage &baked beans). It was sad to find that breakfast didn't come with water, just tea and coffee options.  Requested an omelette but the waiter brought a sunny side up and insisted it was an omelette.   Front desk was quite helpful and courteous.   There's a supermarket on site with a wide range of products. Parking is also available, sometimes gets",April 2021,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Apr 2021,"Lagos, Nigeria","['247 contributions', '46 helpful votes']",30,[]
"friendly staffs, clean rooms.","The swimming pool area is relaxing, and they got an excellent kitchen especially in African cuisine. A good hideaway for someone who likes to keep to himself, also a supermarket in complex which caters to the needs of lodgers which solves a lot of unforeseen problems as i forgot some basic travel things in my first stay there.",May 2018,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Jul 2018,,"['3 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50']"

Parkview Astoria hotel,"Nice place to visit . Safe secure and serene. The new lounge has added aesthetic value to the hotel. Good job to the management. Signature dishes Nigerian delicacies and the ISI-Ewu is divine üëåüëçüèΩ  The Parkview Astoria hotel is purpose built and not a boutique hotel. There‚Äôs adequate space within and outside the hotel. The corridors are open and ventilated. Staff are polite and the new management have an eye for details. There‚Äôs always a senior management staff to take your feedback.  You can also view the World Cup finals open air .  Personally,i think it‚Äôs ideal for all your needs. There‚Äôs a gym, swimming pool and conference rooms suitable for large or small meetings.  The diplomatic suite is contemporary. The decor is mild and there‚Äôs dedicated service.

Not a Bad Place,"I have been here severally and it is a good place to be. The rooms are clean, good customer service however the bathrooms should be improved on. The restaurant too should improve on the time to deliver food to the rooms.

Perfect Stay at the Parkview Astoria Hotel,"I came in contact with the Parkview Astoria product recently and discovered it to be a hidden gem in an otherwise rough environment. Lagos is a the most populous City in sub-saharan Africa. If you've travelled in Africa extensively, you know what that means. Simply, you'll be coming in contact with heavy traffic, a sea of human heads in a very disorderly environment which means a general sense of insecurity. Parkview Astoria Hotel is in one of the most serene and secure but close to major commercial hub of the City accommodation facility offered in this part of Africa.  It is in a gated estate on the Island of Ikoyi in an upscale neighborhood. The facilities are quite adequate for a four star facility and the staff are very friendly and helpful.

"Business meeting at Parkview Astoria Hotels, Ikoyi.","A first time visit to Parkview Astoria Hotels, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos was not disappointing at all. When my Public Relations Officer hinted me about the Hotel, I was not too eager to be there at first but on arriving Parkview Astoria Hotels; starting from the reception...i was impressed by the receptionists as they exhibited thorough professionalism. The meeting room was spaciously arranged and perfectly decorated to suit the day`s purpose.  A quick glance at this hotel`s finishing portrays elegance, serenity and splendour. I never wanted to ""carry last"" and as such I opted to see the rooms, they are beautifully designed I must confess. I look forward to having a nice holiday with my family in this hotel as it is a home away from home with perfect modern amenities.

Avoidable,"Stayed here for a night as the hotel where I had been staying wasn't available for that night. A very ordinary hotel. Medium sized room with an old CCTV. Badly lit. Had a small split AC installed which was leaking profusely, leaving a largish puddle by the morning. The bathroom was wierd. It had an installation of a Jet shower. However, only the tap of the fixture was working, that too providing only a trickle of water. Realised that the fixture had just been put without it being installed. WiFi was provided but was virtually non-functional.  No breakfast spread. Was provided toasted bread and bad tea. The only positives of the hotel are polite staff and its economical rates",November 2015,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jan 2016,"New Delhi, India","['125 contributions', '178 helpful votes']",20,"['Value bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30']"
