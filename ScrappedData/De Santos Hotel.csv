experience at de santos hotel,"Wow! i am opportuned to stay in this hotel, i was there in may and july, i had my wedding photo shoot there and i also had my wedding in their hall. the place and staff was home away from home. I would like to recognize some of the staff that stood out even though all the staff stood out to be honest. i do not like giving review especially when i feel the stay was horrible but this place stood out after being away for years i still had a good experience there. I would first like to recognize the GM which i learned is new Richardo (italian man, married to akwa ibom) i complained about the breakfast because it was chicken sauce and i do not eat chicken and right away they made fish sauce for me, we complained about the rooms that had cockroaches and right away they took care of",May 2021,,,wrote a review Aug 2021,,['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50']"

My Two Nights.,"I came to view the hotel including the rooms as I was planning on using it for my wedding in December but I was not allowed to view the rooms which I found strange. However I decided to lodge here for 2 nights to have a first hand experience of the hotel and its room. I would say it's an amazing hotel and Miriam at the reception was simply one of the best receptionist I have ever experienced, she was full of smiles and so helpful. She is a big credit to this hotel. The rooms were very clean, and smelt very nice. The only negatives were the bathroom hot water was not coming out, and also the TV didnt have as much stations as I thought it will but all the same, I'd definitely stay at this hotel again and will be making a big reservation for my wedding in December. Thanks to all",July 2019,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Jul 2019,"London, United Kingdom",['3 contributions'],50,[]

My 14 nights at De Santos hotel,"My husband & me spent 2 weeks at this hotel. The travel agency recommended this hotel to me for ""Oyinbos"" in Lagos. I've got to say that since the very beginning the recepcionists: Miriam & Charity were pretty nice to us. Porters were very kind too: Samuel and Sundary. About the hotel room was cleaned every single day, it's true I have to tell to use insecticide to prevent from mosquitoes, but they did it for sure: Michael, Kingslery, Ucho and Begi. They changed our towels & sheets too. Staff at the restaurant was quite nice as well, my special thanks to: Ifeany and Wisdom. She always adviced me what to eat and was polite, he always tried to do his best while the room service & was patient. Excellent and plenty buffet breakfast, as well as the special dinners on the weekends.",May 2019,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Jun 2019,"Madrid, Spain","['31 contributions', '18 helpful votes']",50,[]

"Very nice place, perfect for your relax!","I stayed with my husband and my baby child in this hotel for three weeks, from the first day to the last day the staff was always courteous, well-mannered and always ready to satisfy your request. Room cleaned every day, the restaurant and bar high quality (just for me I 'am European too too much pepper I ask many times for dishes without pepper but they didn't understand the meaning no pepper so I didn't order anymore),  for breakfast the chef should prepare something else then Nigerian food, some cookies or croissant ..I eated every days bread and butter ,about this I am sorry..the pool as well was cleaned every day and all available every day.

Superb customer service/stay,"I have stayed in de santos on and off over the past two/three years since I came across it and have never been disappointed by their standards. I initially thought they might have trouble maintaining their standard over the years but my last stay proved me wrong. I think they are here to stay and deliver the best. I was getting married and needed a first class hotel to lodge my guests as some of them would be coming from outside Nigeria and I needed to be sure of their safety and comfort without breaking the bank. They were all pleased with the service and comfort they got in Nigeria and this was largely due to the support and service rendered by De Santos.

I'm very impressed.,"I’ve spent quite a few decades in the U.K. … Akowonjo is where I was born and spent my early growing up years. I could remember friends suggesting Ikeja (mainland) for classic / standard hotels whenever I am in Nigeria.  3 years ago, I was introduced to a new hotel in Akowonjo. At first, I’m a bit skeptical about it until I entered the premises and noticed a hotel of a world of its own! It’s proximity to the Airport and to my family house (where my elderly parents now reside) caught my fancy instantly. The ambience / serenity of the environment and the professional way things are being handled really impressed me.  On my second visit, I thought the excitement of this new hotel would’ve faded like most Nig hotels with problems like lack of management and maintenance, but I was",May 2016,,,wrote a review May 2016,Nigeria,['1 contribution'],50,[]

Bad experience!! Stay away,"Ok I got to say last time I visited this hotel it had a good service and was looking forward visiting nigeria again to stay in the same hotel, this was when the hotel newly opened. I checked in march 2016 and I have to say was not impressed at all. I was given a small standard room saying it was a deluxe room. My bathroom was outdated. With a bucket I really don't know what that was for. You get only one coffee cup and when  I asked for another they said u only get one in the room but the room was booked for two. No glasses. Staines on the duvet. No information on who to call when  need anything. The break fast was rubbish. U got only 2 choices boiled potatoes and dry sausages with baked beans.  I was to stay for a week but check out the next day. I will NEVER visit this hotel",March 2016,,,wrote a review May 2016,,['4 contributions'],20,[]

"The experience remains the same, great!","My family and I were here July last year and it was a wonderful experience. We stayed in the Suite this time and were welcomed with a basket-full of assorted fresh fruits. Rooms were large. This hotel has been a home for us anytime we're in Nigeria. Facilities are still clean, neat and well maintained. 24 hours power supply, non-stop! The gym was great for a nice work-out. I noticed upgraded services this time. Staff were very friendly as usual. As for the food, it was still ok. Complimentary breakfast buffet varies every morning. The overall services were still great, but there's always room for greater improvement to avoid being stale. For us, De Santos Hotel remains the best around the area coupled with its proximity to both the International / local airports.

Bad services never again,I checked into this hotel 2 years ago when i was in the country and it was good so decided to try it again.  but this time i got a shock. I checked in and asked for a dexule room but was given a standard room saying all room are the same. I got to my room it was too small comared to the dexule room i tool last time. The room had insects. The duxet had staines. There was no towels no glasses and only one tea cup. When i asked for another they said they only give one tea cup per room. And when i asked for a towel they brought me one with staines after waiting for two hours. I have to tell u this hotel should be a 2 star. the only plus was the fish i had by the pool. The morning breadfast was the worst i have ever had. There was only pototes and bake beans. No eggs and some silly,March 2016,,,wrote a review Mar 2016,,['1 contribution'],10,[]

Appalling service,If you expect the manager and staff in this place to care about your needs forget it.  The only thing they are interested in is taking your money.  Nightmare! They have no idea about how to run a hotel.  Food on the menu is mostly unavailable and when it is in stock can take 2 hours plus to arrive.   At the breakfast buffet you'd think the staff were paying out of their own pockets so reluctant are they to refill so you can eat.  They just shake their heads and tell you there's none left.   Ask for a refund and they just laugh.   In a room for two they only allow 1 towel and 1 bathrobe.  I coffee sachet and 1 creamer ask for more and it's N1500  more unless you slip the guy some cash!

"It's a good hotel, I'd stay here again.","I didn't want to choose ""average"", but the other choice was ""very good."" This is a good hotel with friendly professional staff, modern comfortable rooms and conveniently close to the airport. Do bear in mind that because you're near the airport there are planes coming into land nearby, but I guess they stop late at night because I didn't have any problems hearing them while sleeping.  There was a rather rowdy crowd of people staying on the floor below me and for some weird reason there are speakers in the passage ways playing rather loud music at night.  The bar is cool and has a pool table. The swimming pool looked lovely, but it was being filled during my stay so didn't have a chance to enjoy it.

Don't believe the brochures etc.,"Hotel rooms are comfortable enough. Room service is slow and they don't seem to know what is on the menu. Descriptions on menu are nothing like what is served! Avoid the hotel buffet at all costs. The Nigerian insistence on cash upfront can be annoying... they have to check with reception to see if you have credit before allowing to sign in the restaurant and for room service.  Twice they delivered room service orders without the bill, but insisted I pay cash...

Our stay was simply fabulous!,"Our stay at De Santos Hotel was simply fabulous. The experience there exceeds our expectations considering the location at first. To us, it’s another home away from home experience. The management and staff there went above & beyond to make our stay very comfortable & memorable. Lots of complimentary services; the breakfast buffet, wi-fi, the fitness centre, just to mention but a few.  Though the front gate of the hotel did not in any way portray the true picture or the ambiance of the hotel, wish the management will do something about this, for people to know that such a place exist in that environment.

Best Hotel Around The Area,"Family friendly hotel with very good services, nice foods and friendly staff as well. Price is ok even as it is a new place, with brand new quality interior decor. Hotel is right on the express way linking Ikeja, Oshodi or Otta. Like the beautiful party organised for the kids on Children 's Day too!

Terrible customer service,"So I and my Fiancé decided to go for a site inspection to see the hall for our wedding reception coming up later this year, the lady that was supposedly supposed to show us the hall and the rooms decided that we weren't worthy enough of seeing the room after keeping us waiting for close to half an hour. We were only allowed to see it on a screen. If I wanted to see it on a screen, I think I would have stayed in my house and checked it out on Google. After getting angry about the poor way she treated us, she also got angry and told us not to teach her her job. Just wow. I didn't expect that from anyone in hospitality. This alone has discouraged us from going there. I mean how are we supposed to want to go back there for anything if we can't even get a proper site inspection.",March 2015,,,wrote a review May 2015,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",10,[]

I went with family for a 9 day stay during the fuel scarcity saga and not once did the hotel dissapoint when there was no light. the generator came on swiftly. The rooms are spacious and the AC was really cool. the ambiance of the halls, and surrounding areas was really nice, lovely decor, nice music and everywhere was clean. the breakfast buffet though small choices was constantly varied everyday, the only downside was there was no juices and the waiters constantly failed to ensure the burnners was on to warm the food.
