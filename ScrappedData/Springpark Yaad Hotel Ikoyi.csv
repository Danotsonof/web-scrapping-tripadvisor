Boutique Hotel is Osborne Foreshore,"Very ""Coded Zone"", you wouldn't know such a hotel existed. Situated in the Highbrow Osborne Foreshore Estate of ikoyi lagos.  Bathroom is Large, Tv reminded me of home, there is a pool and the food is priced just above average.  The colors seemed too sharp but the paint quality is good, the air conditioner was in an awkward position but to be fair the inquired if the room was ok and offered to change the room and I declined.  Will do an update soon as my stay goes along",November 2017,Traveled on business,Ask for the deluxe and avoid the ground floor,wrote a review Nov 2017,"Abuja, Nigeria","['13 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",30,"['Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40']"
