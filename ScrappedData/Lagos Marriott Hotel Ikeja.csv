Excellent Customer Service,"I had an enjoyable stay over the weekend.

MY EXPERIENCE AT MARRIOTT LAGOS,"As a regular traveler to various parts of the world, I have considerable experience with my interactions and the services provided by hotels worldwide.  My experience here at Marriott Lagos is second to none. All the staff here are highly committed, hard-working and amazing warm and very civilised  In particular, I appreciate the following staff: NENE at the 5th floor lounge,  Blessing at the reception, Adeola at the front office, lobby host. They are among the best that the hotel industry in Nigeria and anywhere in the world can afford.  They put in the totality of all the skils that they have to let the guests feel that they are home away from home.

Excellent service,"I had the absolute pleasure of experiencing Mr. Saviour‚Äôs exceptional service at Koriko & Co Buffet Restaurant for the second time, and I must say, he truly went above and beyond to create an unforgettable dining experience for my family and me. From the moment we walked in, his warm and genuine welcome set the tone for what turned out to be an evening filled with culinary delight and impeccable service. Mr. Saviour‚Äôs attention to detail was remarkable. He anticipated our needs before we even had to ask, ensuring our glasses were always filled and our plates never empty.  What truly stood out was his personalized approach. He remembered our preferences from our previous visit and tailored his service accordingly, making us feel like valued guests.

Lux Destination for Family Getaway or Staycation,"My family wanted a comfortable hotel for our Easter staycation and settled on the Lagos Marriot.   Right from the reception, which was buzzing with the comings and goings of the local and international clientele, we felt transported to any number of global destinations.   We had wanted 2 rooms with an adjoining door, but were told that these were no longer available because it was a busy period. Instead we got 2 rooms across the hallway from each other. The rooms were simultaneously sophisticated and cosy. The beds were very comfy and the bathroom clean with powerful showerheads, which the children loved.   The children were quite occupied during our stay. The pool was their favourite destination and they went swimming several times each day.

Luxury stat in Lagos,"Our stay at Lagos Marriott Hotel Ikeja was simply outstanding; a fusion of luxury, excellent hospitality, and mouth-watering cuisine. The staff, including Maureen Nwankwo at the front desk, Bridget, Joy, and Helen, showed genuine care and exceeded our expectations with their attentiveness. Porters Kenneth and George ensured smooth transitions, while Peter's superb service at Azure restaurant elevated our dining experiences.

Amazing Hotel at close proximity to the airport,"The hotel is modern and in a good location at close proximity to the airport. The staff really knows what is meant by ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù - all very professional, friendly and willing to help.  My only concern is the daily room rate which I believe is ‚Äòhyped‚Äô. Attention to little details need to be improved by housekeeping, in terms of cleaning  - tiles grouts stained, mould signs showing on bathroom ceiling and stains on carpets.  We only had breakfast once. It was quite busy that morning (looks like Nigerians are early birds üòä). A lot of the dishes have run out but staff were amazing in getting more food out quickly.

The noisy foyer spoiled my experience,"I came only for the day to work in the foyer and have a meal. The WiFi and plug points worked very well and the buffet was top class. Staff are very efficient and knowledgeable. My one bug bear is the trashy background music playing in the foyer and restaurant which was far too loud and irritating and several requests to staff to make it quieter got no positive response. This was in addition to the very busy (loud?)  conversations from guests. I am sure the rooms are brilliant, but next time I need a day-period to wait for an evening flight, I shall find a different quieter hotel.",May 2023,,,wrote a review May 2023,"Durban, South Africa","['287 contributions', '124 helpful votes']",30,[]
A pleasant hotel that offers all one needs on a business trip.,"Good WiFi, gym with multiple treadmills and a small pool. Rooms are clean and personnel is very friendly. Excellent service and food can be found in the grill bar next to the pool.  Disadvantage: mosque wakes you up early if you're on the wrong side of the building and the ventilation system in the room is noisy and cannot be switched off.  Absolutely worth a visit.

It is a world standard Marriott. Spent 7 nights. The hotel still feels new, check in was smooth, rooms were clean, bed and bathroom was nice. all amenities are present and work as expected. Lobby and restaurants are lively and nice, and executive lounge on 5th is nice for more private setting. Customer service was excellent by everyone, Special shout out to Joy in guest relations.

"One life to live, live it well and enjoy it!","Checked into this hotel from another in Victoria Island so as to be close to the international airport and coordinate a family travel. Took just less than fifteen minutes from the airport to the hotel and back. Hotel is adequately located, very safe, rooms are super comfy and with four restaurants, you are never in lack of food and beverages. Infact, when I offered to take my family out for lunch and dinner, they preferred Azure Grill and Wakame which turned out to be excellent choices. I must commend the trainer of the staff. They are totally well behaved, supportive and always in good spirit. I look forward to coming back soon. Marriott Ikeja must be the best hotel in Lagos currently.

Excellent stay at Marriott Ikeja,"My sister and I stayed at Ikeja Marriott for four nights at the end of May 2022 and we were very satisfied with the service. We arrived early and dropped our bags at  reception and they were looked after until our rooms were ready. Check-in was smooth, my room was clean on arrival and cleaned everyday with towels replaced and complimentary bottled water,  tea and coffee i.e. standard service you would expect.  The food and service at Koriko restaurant was excellent. From amala to pounded yam to the vegetable soup variety; nothing like the taste of proper Nigerian cuisine.

Better than the competition but it's a low bar,I booked here to stay for 5 nights on a business trip. When I arrived to check in they couldn't take payment from my credit card. They tried 2 USD POS machines and 2 Naira ones but all of them declined my card even though my bank told me that no request had been made. I was very close to having to leave the hotel to find somewhere else which is not great late at night just arriving in the country.  The lady checking me in - Elizabeth - was very courteous and polite throughout and eventually agreed to let me check in anyway with a view to trying the card again in the morning. Very kind of her really.  The same card worked first time the next morning - obviously a problem with the hotel POS which just isn't acceptable with this standard of hotel.

The BEST Internationally Standard Hotel in Lagos!,"I was visiting the country and booked 4 nights to stay at the Marriott Ikeja Hotel and one of the days within the stay was my birthday.

The front office team approached the issue with solutions.  Great stuff-  Ambience: Beautiful, beautiful!!! As someone who is well travelled and has stayed in top of the line hotels, the Marriott Ikeja hotel can easily stand side-by-side or even better than Marriotts in the United States and UAE. Architecture had a modern/contemporary feel and everywhere around the hotel area(in and out)",July 2021,,,wrote a review Jul 2021,Virginia,"['25 contributions', '24 helpful votes']",50,[]
Lack luster ..can be better,"I decided to try out the restaurant buffet for breakfast  lunch and dinner and this is what I noticed . The staff in the restaurant need to be trained about Cutlery,  Every time I've eaten at the restaurant I've  had to ask them to put appropriate Cutlery in place to scoop food or pick dessert.  On one occasion  the lady there said I should use the same spoon for one dessert in another.  I had to educate her.  If you cannot get Cutlery right ,I shiver to think of what might happen if I stay . As a bonvoy member I hope they handle thier hiccups because they are in my city .The spread was ok not wow worthy but good enough, The decor shows enough flash but that's not enough for someone like me and my demands are simple enough.  Fix it please.",July 2021,,,wrote a review Jul 2021,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['145 contributions', '28 helpful votes']",20,[]
Nice New Hotel on Lagos Mainland,"Stayed her for 5 days and really enjoyed my stay. It‚Äôs a new hotel so everything was clean and worked as expected. Glad to get standard Marriott hotel experience in Lagos.  Checkin was smooth and fast. The room was clean and spacious, bathroom was nice, bed and pillows were very comfortable, I slept particularly well, Modern decor all around the hotel.  The wifi was really strong which worked perfect for working from the hotel.  The food was just ok, they sometimes ran out of stock of some items, but I‚Äôm sure it will get better as they figure it out. Also lots of beautiful restaurants within walking distance.  The staff was nice, some seemed new but that‚Äôs ok. I was allowed both early check in and a late check out with no hassle. Joy and Bola were particularly nice to me.

"New, but a lot to improve","The hotel just opened recently. Very busy though. There is many hardware and software issues still to fix. The hotel was definitely not ready to open. Obviously the pre-opening period was not used properly for many reasons. The Happy Hour at the executive lounge is a joke...the timing for the breakfast, Happy Hour , opening hours for the restaurants are bad. The service is below standard. Standard room is tiny. No real incentives for titanium members. The pool area is nice though. The lobby is a bestock. The location is ok, but not perfect. The gym is small, but good equipment. By far too expensive for this service. New hotel, but a long way to go for proper international Marriott standard.",May 2021,,,wrote a review May 2021,"Hong Kong, China","['126 contributions', '106 helpful votes']",20,[]
