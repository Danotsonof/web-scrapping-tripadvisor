Home away from home,"I stayed at the George Residence throughout my 12-day trip to Lagos and I wouldn’t have had it any other way.  From my inquiry to the final check-out, the entire staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.   Their rooms were clean, large and well-maintained. Services offered that I partook in and recommend include their dining experience, drycleaning, as well as porter service. The location is also secure (within an estate) and I didn’t feel unsafe at any period.  Will definitely recommend and stay again.",November 2023,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Nov 13,,['1 contribution'],40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
Don't waste your money,"So, this is my second time staying at GR. Now, where do I begin? I'm not sure if GR now has a new management or what, but boy, have they really dropped the ball on this place! I stayed here twice this time around. First in Iroko, the 3 bedroom penthouse and then Tulip, the 1 bedroom apartment.   First let's talk about Iroko. The only thing this place honestly has going for it is the projector, and even that was mediocre at best. The toilet was leaking, the fixtures were barely holding on. Also, for $400/night, I'd expected to get more than 1 towel per room. Heck, even the Sheraton Hotel at Ikeja, which was about half the price, provided about 5 towels for a single room, and here I was being told that only one towel is available per room.  If you need your room cleaned, you must",October 2023,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Oct 2023,,['2 contributions'],20,"['Value bubble_10', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_20']"
Great Hospitality,"We rented the Parkview location for a shoot. The team of staff on site was nothing short of amazing, they assisted us all throughout, but the most amazing of them all was the supervisor on site that day (I cannot remember his name) the shoot happened on the 12th of August 2023. He literally assisted us with everything in the apartment.  Then the customer service team which assisted me in getting the place were superb, I am saying this cause I really stressed them but they were patient and kind to me throughout. Great job guys, definitely working with you guys again.",August 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2023,,['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
