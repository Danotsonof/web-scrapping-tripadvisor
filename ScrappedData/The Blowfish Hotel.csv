Grubby grimy and grim,I cannot support any of the positive from other travellers. My colleague and I had terribly dirty and noisy rooms. Not at all what is advertised on the website. Stains on sheets. Towels stained and Ash grey.  Pool facing room overheard loud music till early hours of the morning. Check the pictures and decide for yourself. Despite poor standard compared to international prices this was expensive.  Good somewhere else.,August 2022,Traveled on business,Don't book here.

Unpleasant Outing,"It was a harrowing experience on the night of 21 May 2022. Had booked and organised a small get together for staff of Globacom. Was astonished to find upon reaching Woks (the restaurant), the disorganised, unconcerned and unprofessional seating arrangement for the guests. One small square table was attached with two larger circular tables on its sides, with wall fixed straight sitting on one side, and independant chairs on the other, which was an extremely inconvenient arrangement for the guests to sit, reach the table, and be able to  enjoy their meals, and the evening. After getting personally involved and demanding change, I was able to get the circular tableat one end replaced with two square tables, and bringing in some sense of alignment.

Little Things Mean A Lot!!,"I stayed at the Blowfish hotel on 13th January 2022. It was advertised as a four star hotel. The signing in was uncomplicated and the reception staff were helpful and efficient. I booked a deluxe room and was taken there. The room was good - neat, tidy and spacious. The air conditioner worked. The bed was comfortable. It was nice to have a bath in the accommodation as well as a shower. So given all of that why does it only merit a rating of 3? Well, because when you book a four star hotel you don't just expect accommodation of good quality - you also expect a four star hotel to have an eye for and an attention to detail. This was sadly lacking.

An amazing experience,"From the moment I walked into the Blowfish I was blown away on how inherently sweet and polite everyone was.The hotel itself was beautiful and well taken care of. Everyday the maid service would come and clean the entire room for us from top to bottom and they were always very respectful. Every night we spent time by the pool and it was always a very relaxing and quiet time. If you pay for it you can have breakfast for two but only one is included in the price, which was abut the only downfall to the hotel.

Great new upgrade in progress,"Over the last six-or- so years, I’ve often stayed at The Blowfish. One of its best features is the choice of restaurants. The selection of local, Indian and especially Italian food is amazing. Right now, the hotel is in the last stages of an upgrade. New pool and new veranda layout. Whilst I miss the old pink, Miami style, the new spaces feel really modern and international. The accommodation is still the same (not really contemporary by world standards) but I personally prefer it to the style-less ‘cool’ of the other hotels in this part of Victoria Island. The service is warm and welcoming. Every time I return the staff greet me by name. It’s my home from home.",March 2020,,,wrote a review Mar 2020,"Cape Town, South Africa",['6 contributions'],40,[]

"My Unwelcoming Experience At Blowfish Hotel, VI Lagos",Very saucy staff especially the cleaners and receptionist (one young man). Imagine the fact that there was a pre-booking for me at the point of my checking the receptionist kept asking me all sort of hilarious questions. He even denied that I had a room in that hotel upon the fact that I surrendered my ID (international passport) for identification.   I had to calmly told him that it is IMPOSSIBLE that my name is not on their expected guest list. This very said guest had to even ask me to call one of my colleagues to confirm whether I am the guest to expect or not upon the fact that I arrived very late in the night and very exhausted.

Terrible attitude,I was in Lagos for a conference and it was my second time in Lagos. I had to cut my stay short at this hotel and moved into another hotel recommended by people at the conference. The staff had terrible attitude and were only after tips. Cleanliness was poor. I got some scary information from the staff after a few tips. I was advise to avoid the lounge because of bugs and avoid the pool because the water wasn't really clean. Breakfast wasn't great either. Very much overrated and previous reviews didn't give honest feedback. Will definitely avoid the hotel  next time.,August 2019,,,wrote a review Oct 2019,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",20,[]

The worst hotel I have ever stayed !!! If you doubt me book for only 1 night first and then see for yourself.,"Even though I paid for 8 nights in the hotel I couldn't bear to spend my entire stay there. I technically checked out after 2 nights but knowing that they wouldn't offer a refund I left the hotel after two nights and left some unwanted belongings  so that they wouldn't give out a room I have already paid for to another guest. I had to pay again to stay in another hotel (I have receipts to prove it) Lighting in the room of this PINK-painted hotel is VERY POOR - no wall lamps, no ceiling lamps - You have to manage with the bedside lamp and an improvised standing lamp which was generating too much heat. Reading or doing anything that needs good lighting is a struggle. The breakfast was very poor and if your rate didn't include breakfast it is very expensive (about $11 - 4,000",August 2019,,,wrote a review Aug 2019,"London, United Kingdom","['7 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",20,[]

I can after almost 2 weeks stay at the hotel pass on this recommendation. Location is perfect for business in Lagos. The overall atmosphere is friendly and homy. You don't get the ""hotel"" feeling and staff is friendly and service minded. Rooms are good and value for money. There are several restaurants and a wide selection of food.

First Class Hotel,I love this hotel. I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week in February 2019 and I cannot speak highly enough of the Blowfish. The staff were so friendly and the room was very clean and comfortable. The staff cleaned it thoroughly every day and stocked the fridge with water. The AC was great and the shower had hot water every time.  The staff went out of their way to make you feel at home and would even go to the supermarket over the road if you needed something. They were very polite and cheerful and really made the stay so wonderful. They were able to negotiate drivers who also acted as tour guides for a very reasonable price.

Dated hotel in bad need of an overhaul,I stayed at The Blowfish for a total of 4 nights.  Check-in was ok and was given a room on the 2nd floor.  There was only 1 lift servicing the entire block and it could at best accommodate 4 persons at any one time.  My room was located right at the end of the corridor next to fire escape which was blocked off with broken furniture.  The room had a slight sewerage smell each and every time I entered. It had a window that faced the pool not that it would have mattered to me.  The room was in bad need of a remodelling and looked like it was there right from the beginning.  Sleep quality was a low average as the mattress I sure was way past its prime.  It was thin and too firm.

We brought guests with us from another country hoping we were entertaining them with a great hotel. At least the management suggested another hotel for us and gave us the same rate.

Nice hotel for a weekend break in Lagos,"A nice relaxing hotel with clean rooms, friendly staff and a stylish decor. Ideally located for getting out and about in Victoria Island and wider Lagos. Rooms are small, but comfortable, with the usual amenities. The hotel has been open a few years and is starting to look a little tired both outside and in the rooms, and the bathroom looked a bit aged.

It comes down to luck which room you get, but you may need to be prepared to ask to move rooms. If you need a very reasonably priced hotel, this is probably a good choice.

Great base for business in Lagos,"Having stayed at most big-brand hotels in Lagos over the years, this is now my regular base when I am in town. Blowfish is a lot more affordable than most hotels here and still provides everything you need.

Great little Boutique Hotel,"I stayed here for 4 nights during a business trip. The location is good (in the heart of the Island), but you need an experienced taxi driver who really knows town to get you there easily which was not a problem for me. They were installing an ATM machine right outside the hotel on my arrival,so hopefully it is up and running, offering convenience for guests inside. The parking/ gate staff were all really welcoming as we entered the compound and the front desk staff were equally nice. The most noticeable thing was the striking decor-think shabby chique French boutique mirrors, chairs, chaise longues etc. The room was equally beautiful and the bed was very comfortable following a 5 hour flight delay!

"Fine hotel for Lagos, something different from the usual chains..","When visiting Nigeria many people will be picky while booking a hotel; safety, clean rooms, good food and comfort will definitely be appreciated more here than in other places of the world. I must admit I was a little unsure about the fact I could not be booked in a well-known chain like Radisson Blu as where I'd stayed before. However, I enjoyed my stay in this smaller and quiet hotel a lot. Staff was friendly, helpful and always, like most of the Nigerians, up for a chat about football. The hotel offers various cuisines (Thai, Continental, Indian and maybe also a drop of Lebanese as per the management I think), and the food was fine in the restaurant next to the lobby and at the poolside.

Nice hotel in a quiet corner of the Island...De-humidifiers in the rooms too!,"Spent a night at the Blowfish and had a good time. The staff at the front desk were courteous and helpful. The room was quite well appointed - soft pillows, good sofa and cable TV. However, the most impressive thing for me was that the management had the thoughtfulness to install de-humidifiers in all rooms to counteract the effects of tropical weather. This meant the room smelt fresh at all times. Breakfast was okay although more variety would have helped. There was a beautiful and clean swimming pool. On the flip side, I was disappointed with the bathroom in my room. The water supply from the taps was coloured and salty. The drain was partially blocked leaving a pool after every shower.

Relaxed atmosphere for business stay,"I have frequently travelled to Lagos, and stayed in rather less than average - below 130 € / night -type of hotels. This time, we chose to go for a more expensive one - 200 € / night - and it proved to be a very effective experience.

The standard Level room was perfectly adequate, but with a few rough edges, could do with some maintenance, such as the shower curtain falling down whilst showering which happened three times and the remote control for the TV did not work. The A/C unit was also badly positioned and blowing directly onto the bed. The food was generally good in the main restaurant, including a nice greek menu. I found the food service was pretty poor around the pool area, there were often 2-3 waiters but they were not very attentive or friendly to the guests.

Wonderful little hotel on Victoria Island,"Recently stayed here for 20 days, and it was a very enjoyable experience. The room was functional and clean, and Nora and the rest of the floor staff treated me with exemplary hospitality. The complimentary breakfasts were great - having fresh pineapple, papaya and watermelon was a nice touch to the morning buffet. There were some tasty dishes served by the two restaurants (Thai/Indian and Italian), my favourites being the butter chicken, palak paneer and any of the pasta dishes from the Italian menu. The weekly Jazz night by the poolside was also a great source of entertainment. Be sure to bring your own iron, if you require de-wrinkling the clothes from your suitcase.

The staff were engaging and happy, the food was amazing with a huge diverse menu covering everything from Thai, Indain and Italian. There is a vast pool and a gym.

Comfortable enough-not recommended for solo women,"II stayed at the Blowfish for four days while traveling in Lagos for business, fortunately I was there with other colleagues, because I would not have felt comfortable as a woman by myself in the hotel. Every time I walked through the lobby I was cat called by the staff-bartenders, waiters, bellboys, who would all stand there and stare and make comments as I walked by-I appreciate you think I look good or whatever, but I feel violated when it happens as I am going for breakfast. The most innappropriate is one of the waiters, kept calling my room, in the morning, at night, whenever I was in my room, even after I asked him to stop.
