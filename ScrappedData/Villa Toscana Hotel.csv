shock,"I lived in this hotel for 4 months. After washing, I found my blouse torn. The manager asked me how they can fix this situation. I called the cost of blouses $ 50. The manager replied that they could only pay $ 20. It's shame! Such a disgusting attitude to the guest who paid for the hotel 4 months, as well as additional washing, kitchen and bar services. I planned to go back to Taskana's Villa on my next trip. But, I think these guys are not able to negotiate.",April 2023,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Apr 2023,,['1 contribution'],10,[]
