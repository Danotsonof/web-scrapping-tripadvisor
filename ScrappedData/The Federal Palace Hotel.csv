Would not stay here again.,"Stayed a week during a business trip and it was really not enjoyable. No separate showers, shower head in the bath and water was only lukewarm despite asking them to turn it up. Waited 2 hours for room service after I was told that it will be 30-35 minutes when I ordered. Luckily the food was good but after 2 hours of waiting it was not worth it. Experience in the restaurant during the evenings was similar.  Food orders took forever. Gym well equipped and clean - a pity the air conditioners did not work which made it almost unbearable as there are no opening windows.

The best hotel in Lagos.,"I have returned to this hotel since 2006. Its a beautiful place and most importantly the team or people who have continued to make my stay memorable. Ekene at the concierge is a dream, very polite, welcoming and helpful. Mathew and Andrew at the check in desk makes our check-in smooth and easy. Peace at the pool wearing a huge smile, polite and playful. Bukola knows everyone at breakfast. She is very friendly, knows her returning guests and still extends the same courtesy to new guests. The cleaners do an amazing job with cleaning the rooms. Flower pots well tendered to. You have the best team and a lot of them have been working here for years, tells a lot about the management.

Dr Leonard,"The hotel is very neat and clean both outside and in the rooms. The whole place is full of ambience.  I've stayed in this hotel a couple of times, mostly for business visits and everytime it has been a marvelous experience.  The food is good, the staff are friendly but very business like. The front desk is very professional in the way they handle issues.   However, there are few low points. 1. The containers from which food is served in the kitchen are very old and would require urgent replacement.

Loud Music at Midnight,The iconic hotel is an enduring testament to Lagos' entertainment industry and the facility remains well maintained. The hotel hosts one of the city's most popular event venues -the Balmoral. The downside though is that it is not soundproof.  I was kept wide awake as loud music blared all night and I wondered if the hotel was bothered at all. It seems they make more money from events than the hotel lodgings.,December 2021,,,wrote a review Jan 2022,"Berlin, Germany","['357 contributions', '28 helpful votes']",30,[]

The meal plan we chose was so apt for the children and occasion, it is an experience they would not forget in a hurry. It also was very relaxing for me as I didn't have to run around much to engage them much, the event centre already does that. The staff were also very helpful, patient and kind.

Staycation.,"Some of the best things about our staycation- Seaview from my room was fantastic, quality of bed was very good and comfortable. However, I'd say room and bathroom needs a facelift, it's good for the past standard, but definitely needs a bit of an upgrade. Food definitely needs to be improved upon, there should be more variety and it should be more tasteful, I had higher expectations due to hotel's reputation. Music live band was pretty good, they improved our experience. The porter that assisted us with our luggage upon arrival was very helpful,courteous and professional. Generally, I had a good experience, a few glitches that upset me, I wish we got more value for the money. I'd recommend a stay at the hotel anyways, depending on your needs.",April 2021,,,wrote a review Apr 2021,Nigeria,['1 contribution'],30,[]

Federal Palace 3.5/5,"This hotel is acceptable all things considered. It is located in VI, a nice place to be in and the security is second to none. It is also very spacious if that's your thing and the staff are great. I am very objective in my reviews and this one is no different. I hope the management will take some of my points highlighted below to improve their services. It is a pitty to see a grand hotel in such a state. The Hotel firstly needs a bit of a face lift. And I don't just mean aesthetics. I also mean on the social front. It was built in the 1950s through 60s as a grand establishment and no doubt was glamorous back then, however today it is less than a shadow of its former self.  I stayed in a sea facing room.

"The Fed Palace remains a good hotel, but ...","During a recent visit to Lagos did my hosts book me at the Federal Palace Hotel.  While check in was swift did logging on to WiFi take a bit of time which however was soon resolved. My room presented itself generally clean and maintained but - like the entire hotel, especially the second wing which is closed - requires a major refurbishment to bring it back to its former glory.  Staff, wherever I encountered them, from housekeeping to security, were friendly and cheerful. I enjoyed daily breakfasts with a good spread of choices on the cold and hot buffet though would not recommend to try the Eggs Benedict.

BREAKFAST BUFFET FEDERAL PALACE HOTEL LAGOS,"I approached the breakfast buffet with no preconceptions. I was therefore pleasant surprised at the quality of the food. It was a good spread of food which for the most part tasted very nice. There were two disappointments to the food. The first was my omelette. It was terribly done. The chef burned the omelette, how do you burn eggs? The second were the pancakes which looked anaemic and thus very uninviting. Other than those the food was very good. The whole wheat bread served is possibly the best whole wheat bread i have ever eaten, please do not toast the bread to eat. Eat it plain. A word of advice for the hotel, they should have a bakery that sells the bread.   The service of the servers was below average.

However the security guys are saucy and messing up the good work by the guys at the restaurant, front desk reception area, the guys at the bar.

It is good for Lagos...,"Stayed there one night in March. Air conditioning was okay but would not want to test it out during the hotter months. Breakfast was very good and included in the room price that I got ($160/night). I didn’t try the gym and pool but heard it was very nice. Could not get WiFi to work, even with a trip to reception to try and get it sorted out. Two small bottles of water in the room were complimentary which was nice. 1800 Naria for a local beer at the bar. 2000 for a large Heineken.

"An island of calm, quiet, security and luxury in a fun but crazy city!","This was my first visit to Lagos and Nigeria. I’d read a lot about the busyness, the traffic, the noise and I had some security concerns about a city I wasn’t familiar with.   I chose the Federal Palace because it looked secure and comfortable. It certainly didn’t disappoint and exceeded my expectations.   From I arrived in the lobby I felt welcomed  and settled. The customer service is superb and everyone I met went out of their way to make sure I had a good time.   The room was a good size, very very comfortable bed with a nice view of the ocean (see my pics).   My favourite part of the hotel experience was the breakfast, make sure you get this included with any deal. It’s 7,500N (about £15) if you pay as a walk in, which is still worth it.

The almost perfect weekend stay,"We did a family weekend at the Federal Palace hotel. The ambiance and general area feels and looks good. The rooms are a little small but ok. They had a few toiletries but missing a few essentials like toothbrush , toothpaste etc. Also no robes and slippers. However they provided kettle, tea, coffee, milk and about 2 complimentary bottled water. The staff I must say were polite and helpful right from the entrance, reception , housekeeping and the restaurant staff.  Oddly, only one person per room gets complimentary breakfast, others had to pay. They did have a good spread, but a bit on the high side at N7,000 per extra. For some strange reason, I was told I couldn’t take pictures of the food display, I asked why and I was told “management rule” which didn’t make any sense to me.",July 2018,,,wrote a review Jul 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria","['459 contributions', '61 helpful votes']",30,[]

Far from 5*!,"While choices are limited in Lagos, I have stayed here a couple of times.    The people are very nice and generally the hotel offers good amenities.    That said - the rooms are at 3 star at best.  Look at the photos for why.  The bathroom is horrible.  The room is a little cramped - though clean.    The bathrooms need to be renovated - urgently.  Then perhaps we can feel like it is 4-Star.  Until then - manage your expectations.    On this occasion I will bring these defects to the hotels attention. Broken sink. Shipped enamel on tub.

I cannot fault this hotel,"I was recently in Lagos on business for 9 nights. 5 of us travelled together. I am usually very fussy when it comes to hotels and I must say,  The Federal Palace delivered on all levels. I can't, however, give it  5 stars. The staff are extremely friendly. The actual hotel is huge and feels like it is 'outside' of the city. Being on the lagoon helps, although it is not the most attractive place. The swimming pool is incredible. It was a saviour for me.The food at the restaurant isn't amazing, but it does the trick. The breakfasts are better than the dinners.  The 1st night in the hotel, my air conditioner was making a terrible noise the 1st night. I called downstairs and they sent a maintenance man up to fix it.

OK business hotel in Lagos,"Stayed at the Federal Palace several times this year, and each time I leave with same observations. Overall it's acceptable, but I find a few things irritating - the hotel won't send you an iron and ironing board to your room, they'd rather iron things for you. Bathrooms are very underwhelming and urgently need renovation. I always seem to get a room overlooking a busy/ugly area looking like the roof of the hotel restaurant (avoid such rooms), and there's always noise there. There's also constant electricity outage and the associates noise of the generator. The breakfast spread is generous, though there are never bananas (which I always look for to grab with me), and it seems impossible to get an apple - have to get permission of the chef himself.

Mixed feelings,"I stayed at the Federal Palace for six nights on a business trip, and have mixed feelings about it.   The hotel occupies a large plot over-looking Lagos Lagoon. This is less romantic than it sounds as the view is quite industrial but interesting if you like watching large container ships and tankers which pass very close by.   There's very little of interest in the immediate vicinity of the hotel (but that's probably true of many Lagos hotels) and you wouldn't want to try strolling outside the hotel. The hotel seems very secure, with good vehicle security and plenty of security in the lobby.   The public areas of the hotel are very spacious and nicely furnished. Bedrooms are comfortable but nothing special. The hotel is in a good state of repair and most things seemed to work,",November 2017,,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"London, United Kingdom","['20 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",30,[]
Great Staff but Improvements Needed,"I stayed at the Federal because I was looking for a different experience from my previous visits to Lagos. I requested for a sea-view room - which I got but it was on the 2nd floor and there was a view of a low-level building within the hotel premises. Keep this in mind when you book. Then there were the incessant fire alarms. There were no fires nor was anyone alarmed. I was told that sometimes it is triggered when guests smoke in non-smoking rooms! Otherwise I enjoyed my stay. The staff were very helpful and courteous.

Also no iron or ironing board in the rooms, upon request I was told I needed to pay for my clothes to be ironed....Seriously??? Then the issue of random people just roaming the hotel and it's environs just made it seem like a public place than a 5star property.

Excellent all round,I was a long term guest whilst on a business trip to Nigeria.  The Federal Palace is by far the best hotel in Lagos.  It is situated in the heart of Victoria Island (the CBD) yet you would not know it.  The hotel has large immaculately kept gardens which border the lagoon and as such you are shielded from the noise of Lagos.  It is hard to believe that you can find peace and quiet in Lagos but this is the place!  The facilities are first rate.  The pool is large and ideal for swimming lengths.  The tennis courts are in excellent condition.  The gym is well equipped and air conditioned with plenty of cold water and fresh towels.

All around....just okay...,"Stayed in this hotel several nights and overall, as the title says, the stay was just ""okay."" While the hotel tries to compete with other high end hotels, it needs to step up its game in several areas.  First, when the hotel does decide to do a renovation, something it is currently in need of, the guest room bathrooms should be first on the list (see photos).  The bathrooms have one of the mid-90's design elements - a half door on the shower with no shower curtain or full enclosure.  This is a huge mistake.  To take a shower means spraying the bathroom with water to the point of near flood.  I used every last towel trying to mop it up before leaving my room for the day.  Second, the breakfast buffet.

The only thing during my stay was that the pool was closed for maintenance. This I do however not see as a negative as it shows they do at least maintain their property, which cannot be said of all hotels around here. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Lagos.",January 2017,,,wrote a review Jan 2017,"Fonthill, Ontario","['23 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",50,[]
Willing but not able,"The Federal is an interesting place. The ambience is colonial a Africa but 1970's style. The rooms are pleasant and most have a great view to the lagoon. They are a bit run down and old and the plumbing requires your patience but the mini bar is stocked. The lobby area, bar and terrace are very nice indeed as are the various peacocks that roam freely. The garden is very pleasant but the pool not what it should. The staff are genuinly warm and helpful and security is good. The F&B is of a very poor quality although served ceremoniously and is ultra expensive. Not a bad choice but there are better and more economic choices in Lagos.

Hotel presentation emaculat, from entering the hotel down to the rooms.  Outdoor swimming pool in beautiful surroundings and clean.  Food fabulous and service also.  Only reason I didn't give a five star rating was down to the stained carpets in the hallways to the hotel rooms.  No issue with the room flooring though.

Nice hotel with lots to explore,"We checked in December 30 with our son for a family getaway for 4 nights. The rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. We didn't order any other food apart from breakfast as we ate out a lot but they have a very generous breakfast spread with lots and lots of variety. Tastes good too. They've got a wide variety of activities: a lovely pool area with different sections, mini golf course, game arcade, bouncy castle, tennis court. I'm sad we didn't explore it all. They've also got large expanse of land where you can take walks or take in the lovely view of the water.

Slightly above average,"Was here with my family again in late December into the New Year.  As usual it had a few activities for kids like the water slide and pool area which was almost over crowded, a game room and a bouncy castle just sit up for the season.  Check in was very poor as the rooms I had paid for were given up but after complaints and a demand for a refund, I was eventually granted two sea facing and interconnecting rooms which is what I had earlier requested for and paid for in advance.  Breakfast at the hotel was above average with a fair amount of options to choose from.

My Favorite Hotel in Lagos,"The Federal Palace is definitely my favorite hotel in Lagos. It's in a great location near in my opinion, some of the best restaurants and clubs in Lagos.   While the Federal Palace isn't the most modern hotel, its definitely a classic. The hotel is definitely not as modern and cutting edge as a lot of newer hotels but its charming.   I'm probably a bit biased though because it reminded me of traveling with my parents as a child and checking into what I thought were ""big"" hotels and looking round in wonder.   The grounds are definitely more ""resort"" like and I personally love that the pool and golf course is situated a bit away from the hotel (and I love the area for the kids).

The room was a good size, and bed was comfortable.  However, the bath was missing its plug, and I battled to communicate with housekeeping to get one.  I found the pillows too high, and having requested a flatter pillow, I got one that had such bad stains on it, that they showed through the pillowcase.

Federal Palace Stay,From start to finish I have been blown away by the service of the team at Federal Palace. Over the past 2 weeks I have had the opportunity of staying  at The Federal Palace twice in two weeks.  I found the rooms to be very comfortable and very clean. Loved the fact that they have a walk/running parth set in lush garden environment.

All round great experience and helpfulness,The Intercontinental couldn't accommodate me on a prepaid booking so I went to Federal Palace.  From the beginning to end it was a pleasant experience.

Not all 5 star hotels are equal,"I founf the entrance hall impressive.  The check in was easy. I found the room small, but adequate. I was warned not to eat at the hotel unless I had to.  I enjoyed breakfast. Both in room meals I ordered, was not good value and neither was it good quality. Compared to other 5 star hotels, I was disappointed. The first meal was late and incorrect. The second was a very small portion. The hotel has a great foyer and is geared well for business meetings. For travellers who do not want to travel to meetings and have meetings in the hotel, this is a great setting to do this.",July 2015,,,wrote a review Jul 2015,South Africa,"['255 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",30,[]

Favourite hotel in Lagos,"This hotel is a gem away from from the hustle and bustle of Lagos city. It's gardens and pool area are one of the few green spots in Lagos and provides that breathe of fresh air that is often needed when travelling in a chaotic place. The hotel is expensive but compares favourably with the other upper end hotels in the city. Dining at hotel can become a bit boring as the menu never changes and is very limited. Service is slow so don't be in a hurry. Room quality is excellent, the room is clean and I always sleep comfortably. Staff are very willing to help.

4 star quality at most,"I do not think that this is a 5 star quality hotel and it is certainly not worth the money which they are asking for it. Starting with the booking process, I requested a car pickup and airport “Protocol” service. This resulted in a separate form arriving requesting a lot of personal information (e.g. date of birth) and a photocopy of both sides of my credit card. When I pushed back to say that this should just be added to the room bill and hence providing that information seemed unnecessary they accepted my point and arranged it for me. This worked well and the airport piece was fairly painless (i.e. I did not have to pay any bribes).  When you get to the hotel and check in you are charged for the full cost of the room upfront. I have had cases of hotels “reserving” the money",June 2015,,,wrote a review Jul 2015,Hong Kong,"['30 contributions', '50 helpful votes']",20,[]

Surprisingly good hotel,"A great hotel that offers a calm and tranquil atmosphere. It has an excellent pool complex with slide. Shade was in short supply around the pool as the sun parasols were ineffective. The free crazy golf looks great fun but it was too hot for us in the sun. Also the out door fitness stations were well maintained.   The hotel food and drink was of the usual Nigerian standard, mixed. Some was excellent, the breakfast for instance was fantastic with so much choice. The Friday evening buffet in the restaurant was the best I have ever had in Nigeria. So much choice and such good quality food. However the USUAL buffet served in the bar area was the worst I have ever encountered.

There is a recent addition to one part of it that gives it a new and modern ambience.   We checked a colleague into the room. It was clean, spacious and comfortable.

The peppersoup was hot and spicy. Just as we like it. But I observed that both the peppersoup and the vegetable soup I ordered to go with the pounded yam was heavily laced with thyme and curry.

"Good Hotel, Nice location","I stay at the Federal Palace every time I come to Lagos given the proximity to our office.  With every stay, things get better.  The latest addition of the tray of 'welcome cakes' in your room on arrival is a great touch!  Keep that up!  And a stocked mini-bar is also a welcome addition. I have also noticed that they have taken the comments of airconditioning into account - it was too cold at one stage and this is much better now.  It's in a great location overlooking the water. The one suggestion that I would make that would improve the experience is the fluctuating water tempreture in the showers.  The showers go from hot to cold to hot to cold so you have to keep hopping in and out under the water. Would be great if this could be fixed. But overall, a good experience, with",March 2014,,,wrote a review Mar 2014,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['17 contributions', '9 helpful votes']",40,[]

A superb hotel!,"This was my first stay in Nigeria and I was extremely pleased to have been staying at the Federal Palace. The staff was very friendly and the service was as good as any top hotel in the world! I was upgraded to a large room, which was a nice surprise after a long flight. The staff were attentive and could not do anymore to help.  The rooms were very nice, with full UK and US television. They have huge comfortable beds with very clean and up to date bathrooms.

Very good overall experience,"I always stay at this hotel when visiting Lagos, the hotel is in Victoria Island. The hotel is fairly new with all the normal room amenities, flat screen TV, AIRCON, Mini Bar, Free WiFi. The hotel service is consistent, the breakfast caters for a variety of tastes and on par with most five star hotels. The gym is well equipped with Technogym equipment. There is a pool with slides for kids, outdoor obstacle course for fitness fanatics. Try the local restaurants for dinner because the buffet can get tedious after a few days and the menu doesn't change much, there is a la carte menu though if you don't feel like going out. Try Spice Route restaurant if you like Indian/Chinese cuisine, it's on Victoria Island not far from hotel.

Amazing Short Break.,"I arrived at the Hotel and was pleasantly surprised, lovely decor and a warm and inviting atmosphere. Staff were friendly and always at hand to help. Facilities were up to date and food served offered a variety of native and continental dishes. Surroundings were clean and modern, and rooms were to a high standard, bed and pillows were extremely soft and gave us a great nights sleep. I would definitely recommend this hotel for couples and families as there is so much to do and is easily accessible to other areas in Lagos.

My room was very comfortable and clean, and the bed was wonderful.   The gardens and facilities at this hotel are great - there is a decent gym, beautiful pools, mini golf, and more. There is also a walking path along with water, just be weary that the water is full of garbage...  Food at the hotel is great, especially the breakfast buffet.

Hands on manager ensures good service,If you need to conduct business in Lagos I would recommend this hotel. There are beautiful Grounds and hospitable service. The food costs were very high though so if you are on an expense account you may have a problem. The Lebanese Manager was always on the floor of the hotel greeting guests and was always available. I can t say there has ever been a hotel manager providing this degree of service. My only comment is that if you order room service the prices in the room dining book aren't accurate. For example in room dining for two Oceans wine was 4000 naira but in actual fact is 5500.  Pls change these prices. It is annoying to order room service and be blindsided by a different price.,January 2014,,,wrote a review Jan 2014,"Bay of Quinte, Canada","['66 contributions', '61 helpful votes']",40,[]
"A nice hotel, far from anything real in Lagos","The Federal Palace Hotel is a nice place to stay, right on the waterfront, and with quite large grounds. Safely located on VI, it is far from the hustle and bustle of Lagos, and certainly provides a safe and sanitized stay in Nigeria's biggest city. The staff are very friendly, and the breakfast menu, in particular, is exceptional.  For some reason, the AC in the lobby/public areas is set very low, to the point that one has to wear a jacket or jumper at night in the restaurant.  I wish they did not do that.  My bedroom was clean and comfortable, although a noisy AC meant I had to use ear plugs at night.  This is a nice hotel, with clean facilities and helpful staff . . . but if you are visiting Lagos, wishing for a taste of the city and culture,  this is not the place to stay.",January 2014,,,wrote a review Jan 2014,"Thunder Bay, Canada","['65 contributions', '52 helpful votes']",40,[]

The staff and management are, without exception, warm, friendly and attentive, welcoming me back each time as though I have come home!

The location is ideal for the VI business district. Breakfast, in particular, is good with a wide range of food and the service on the bar and terrace has improved considerably recently.

"Very average, even by Lagos standards","This hotel should be better frankly but seems to lacks strong management, despite being managed by the Sun International hotel group. Renovated and re-opened a few years ago, the rooms are already looking tired. Food is average at best and pretty awful at times. Room service one night took about 50 minutes.  Like all hotels in Lagos, it is significantly over-priced but seems to get a lot of South African business, perhaos because of the brand. I suspect that there is too much concentration/focus on the Casino - you certainly don't see active hands-on management in the hotel.

The hotel is well located for the Victoria Island business district with easy access to most major corporate HQs. Also excellent proximity to Lagos nightlife, restaurants etc . Impressively decorated lobby area and a rather nice bar and lagoon front terrace. Which makes the tiny, rather average rooms a bit of a disappointment. Service is extremely slow- it took ages to check in, I waited 45mins and 1 hour respectively for room service and over 40 mins for an adapter to be brought up to my room.

Tranquility amid chaos,"This was my first trip to Lagos and after my airport experience and security escort, arrived here with a sense of dread. The architecture of the hotel is very old school, echoing its 1960 establishment and the former visions of pan-African glory - it was here that the country's declaration of independnece from Britain was signed. The grounds are pretty on the back, waterfront-facing side and quite lush, but the front is partly ruined by the now seemingly empty shell of the local secratariat tower that housed government officials before the capital moved to Abuja.

Very disappointing Hotel,"It was recommended as the best Hotel in Lagos for our meeting and stay. The only impressive thing was the view of the Sea. However even this is taken away by dark heavy curtains covering the windows in the lobby. The service received was terrible. The restaurant used for dinner should not bother offering anything al a Carte. The salad ordered did not contain the items stated on the actual menu and came without dressing. We waited for nearly an hour to be served. The guest rooms smell damp as the AC is turned off completely when not occupied.

A homelike atmosphere and truly fantastic staff,"I have stayed in this place quite a few times during numerous business trips to Lagos in the past three years. The hospitable staff, nicely decorated rooms,a wonderful terrace, picturesque garden overlooking the Lagos lagoon and the magnificent pool - these are all the elements of a quality hotel, which is quite hard to find in a place like Lagos. The rooms are quite spacious, and be sure to book one overlooking the garden and the waterfront - every now and then a grand ship would pass to and from the Lagos port, a scene, which proves to be quite spectacular for those who don't live on the seashores. For food lovers, breakfasts as well any other meal of the day are very thought-through, and, compared to other hotels in the city, offer food for every taste, ranging from",February 2013,,,wrote a review Apr 2013,"Moscow, Russia","['51 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",50,[]

a fantastic place to stay in Lagos,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  It is an oasis of calm in the middle of a very busy, security conscious city.  The hotel is set within a wonderful area where you feel totally safe and can enjoy the amazing facilities - the garden is on the water and has a gentle breeze and there is a large clean pool to swim in.  The rooms are comfortable and the beds are fantastic - The bathrooms are nothing to write home about and are spotlessly clean.  Mine looked a little 'tired'.

Good choice for business and leisure,"It was my first stay at this hotel in Lagos and definitely it will become by first choice for coming trips, better than  the previously one tried in the city. The hotel is In Victoria Island and although is completely secure, you do not have the sense of being inside a prison as you do at other Lagos hotels. The hotel is surronded by large green extensions both  at back and front sides. The back one  gets to the water, so from the bar, restaurant or your room if you are lucky ( and I was!), you can see the ships permaently passing in both directions. The hotel has a fitness center adn a swimming that I did not try, but they looked good and well equiped. The hotel makes you feel confortable from check in moment, all is easy.

Holiday/Business in Lagos,"I travelled on my own, and met up with my husband, who was already in Lagos on business. From the moment I arrived, I was treated like a queen! The Federal Palace had organised someone to meet me as I got off the plane, to see me through Customs and into a waiting vehicle to the hotel. Once I arrived, I was met by people intent on making my stay memorable! Overall, it is the warmest, most hospitable hotels I have stayed in. From the driver through to the top management, people were superb, food was divine, and I would go back for a holiday and take my kids in a heartbeat!

I arrived late in the evening after a rather bumpy ride from the airport and it was great to arrive in a cool hotel. The reception staff were friendly and had no issues checking in.  The actual rooms when you think about how much you pay are average at best. I tried to grab some food and drink from the restaurant which left a lot to be desired - I could only eat the fries. The drinks are very expensive and the service exceptionally slow.  The breakfast is pretty good so I would give them a tick for that.

Best Hotel in Lagos,"The Federal Palace is a genuinely good hotel. For Lagos, and for the majority of Africa in fact, it is a tremendous hotel.  As with all hotels in this part of the world the price tag is rather steep, but the Federal Palace can get away with it as it is in my opinion the best Hotel in Lagos, with the Radisson closely behind.  The food was very good (a friend claimed to get food poisoning from the Dinner Buffet but it could have been from a multitude of sources).  The rooms were what you would expect from any global 'business-focused' hotel.  The service desk was as more efficient than most (but beware that relative to the rest of west Africa).

The rooms are standard, I didn't have soap in my room on check-in. Additionally there was a major issue with hot water which sputtered out of the shower.

Surprisingly Nice place for dinner.,"Went to Federal Palace for dinner during the week., I was pleasantly surprised. I have not been there in years so the renovation to the whole structure (at least from the lobby and restaurant) looked very good. The staff was not exactly friendly but they were very attentive and practically were always only a head nod away. The food was good and the drinks were ok. You pay to park but if you stay for a meal, then your ticket is stamped so you don't have to pay for parking any longer. The price is regular for Victoria Island but if you are from the mainland (or just any normal person) the prices can be steep.

Interesting mix,"The ambiance and décor are next to none. The place is beautiful and most of the staff are very warm and friendly. However they need a little more training with how they treat their female guests. Not all are there at the invitation of a man. We also come for business and relaxation. Then the color of the water in the bathroom is questionable. One will expect that a hotel of such standards should have a water treatment plant. Also those in charge of house keeping should be trained on proper etiquette. If the rule is to put face flannels in the bathroom, then do so without expecting to be tipped or threatened.

Last night I had the Peppered Fillet of Beef 280g , now I swear it was 150g and was rubbery and did not even have garnish.  Cost 5800 NGN or 39 US$.  I travel a lot and am used to high prices and bad service in Lagos which the hotels seem to just accept but this is extreme.  Tonight I ordered Slow Roasted Osso Bucco – cost 6300 NGN or 43 US$ it is as tough as my New Rock shoes. I posted a photo on FB it is unbelievable. As a South African I am ashamed at how Sun International rip off or accept this kind of standard. Nigerians are extremely enterprising and clever.

A Palace in the hub of the city,"My first visit to Federal Palace Hotel & Casino was a memorable one because it left me speechless. At first, i thought it was one of those regular hotels in Nigeria but was amazed to find a hotel as good as ""The palace"". My fiance (now husband)took me there to mark my birthday and peeps, i spent the time of my life. The room was exqusite and the food was sumptuous with several to choose. The beautiful swimming pool was a thing to behold and the casino was on point! the casino has several games but i spent most of my time on horse racing and slot games which i did enjoy.

"Eye wateringly expensive, but Western standards in West Africa","The Federal Palace would hold its own in London or Paris in terms of decor and service.  It's extremely expensive, but in return you have none of the hassles that await you in other hotels in the region.  Well located for business and set inside a large set of grounds with an excellent swimming pool, gym, modern rooms and even a casino, the Federal Palace really is top quality.  You can understand why it's so expensive - doing this sort of things can't be cheap in Nigeria.  Smoking colleagues complain that you can't smoke in any of the rooms.  I can see why this is annoying, given that guests at the FP are more likely to be smokers than those in, say, a business hotel in LA.

Decent and comfortable BUT,"Stayed 3 nights whilst on business trip  Generally well kept, bright, airy and comfortable, and certainly a welcome oasis in the hustle and bustle of Lagos  Commentary by some on this site, on prices being too high, misses the point I think- considering they have to run a generator continuously to keep the power going + ship in 2 containers of food every week (at least that’s what kitchen staff claim)  etc etc I feel room price is fair  Staff are generally friendly although a sulky few remain here and there (keep working on them madam manageress)  Issues for me are:  a.

I leave my comment here as all the staff make sure you don't get to speak with anyone in a position of authority beyond the figure-head duty managers that have little or no orientation about customer service and satisfaction. I am Nigerian and all the times I have stayed the only 2 soups served in-room are Egusi and Ogbono with either Poundo Yam or Garri.

I really appreciate the vast expanse of the lobby and garden space, the cozy and tranquility atmosphere within. Check out the swimming pool.....great place, very resort like, probably the best in town. Rooms and amenities are good though a touch of Heston Blumenthal and Gordon Ramsay may induce some extra character and oomph in the food menu and wine list.

Best Hotel In Lagos,"Federal Palace ( Hotels & Casino ): ""Great Business & Family Hotel"" Date: 25 July 2011  I booked this hotel for a Month stay in Lagos mainly based on its #1 rating by my friends. And it is a unique little gem, really.  We have stayed at many hotels over the years, often luxury ones with impeccable details and fantastic designs. Price-wise Federal Palace is on par with these better-class hotels. But the comparison fails: Federal Palace is  a luxury place. Yet, in ten years from now, I’m sure we will still fondly remember the business trip & vacation we had there.  It is the perceptive and friendly service that makes it worthwhile staying in this small family-run hotel.

Great stay - treated like royalty,"I stayed there for a month or so. It was like a peaceful island in what is an absolutely buzzing city. The attached facilities are great - it is difficult not to spend time around the (super) pool and sports facilities. The gym is certainly modern and well equipped. Top cudos, though, go to the staff (and the concierge desk in particular). They were great. Courteous but friendly, and nothing was too much trouble. It is difficult for me to write a ""balanced"" report, but if I had to say that there is one thing that could do with improvement, it is the time taken between the ordering of food and getting it. It is too long. Notwithstanding this, though, when I asked the kitchen to organise stuff that a normal hotel would not have, they obliged with the greatest of grace.

The manager at reception, a chap named Mohamed, is a super chap, tries his best, and goes over and above the call of duty. BUT THERE IS ONE BIG PROBLEM. THE WATER FROM THE TAPS IN THE HOTEL IS YELLOW - see photograph. Worse still, the South African management is in denial and took offence when I pointed out that the water is yellow and unfit for use.

An fine example of whats wrong with Nigeria,"Best view in Lagos, but unfortunately, a prime example of the shambles Nigeria is in – priced jewels owned by powerful families or individuals who aren’t very good managers and run their assets down.  There are two FP’s – one on the left, the new and shorter wing, is now run by Sun International and costs more than twice that of the old wing (where I stayed).  However, in my opinion the cost difference isn’t justified as the older one has larger rooms (though much shabbier) and better views as the building is taller.
