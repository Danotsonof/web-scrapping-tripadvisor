Nice rooms,"It's a bit out of the way and looks small from the outside, but the space is very large and the rooms are spacey, clean, comfortable.   The bathrooms are also large and clean, and one of the best features is the incredible water pressure in the shower (which DOES also have hot water).  We did not use the pool, but it looked clean and had a nice atmosphere.  The one area that needs improvement is the kitchen services.  Staff did not to have good customer service skills (it was also often hard to get a hold of or find the front desk staff in a timely manner).  Many items on the menu were not available, and what was available was not great - the Indian food (at least the biryani we ordered) was far from authentic.  Service was slow and prices were on the high side.

"Comfortable, Peaceful and Good Food","Stayed in this hotel for just one night but I am sure I am going to stay in this hotel, whenever I am going next. This place offers to comfortable stay, nice big room, clean bathroom, swimming pool, good WiFi connectivity, peaceful stay and nice food. What else you look for in a hotel?  And if you need to party, opposite there is a bar and you have discotheque nearby, so this place is idle for people who are looking for all the facilities mentioned above.

100% Value for money,"I have been staying at Atlantic Hotel in Ikeja GRA for past 3-4 trips to Lagos and I am humbled by their service and hospitality. It gives me a feeling of home away from home. I get great indian food, i can watch indian tv shows and games, there is a pool and a bar next to it so you can relax at the end of the day, rooms are nice, big and spacious. Internet is free and it is fast. I must also appreciate the size of the bathrooms - they are huge.  Very quiet and lush setting. I just love coming and staying here. The Manager Mr Sunil is a very cooperative man and he goes all out to ensure you have a comfortable stay.  I cannot think of any other hotel in Ikeja GRA to stay in.",October 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Nov 2017,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India","['94 contributions', '27 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"

The best of all the hotels i stayed in during my recent visit,"We didn't have any breakfast or dinner so I cannot comment on those however everything else was really good. By far the best thing about our stay is the speed of the WIFI. The size of the rooms are massive, the bathroom facilities are brilliant except for the fact that hot water may run out before you have a shower. We stayed in a total of 4 hotels during this trip and this was right up there in terms of overall package. The staff are very helpful and attentive. The hotel is also very secure and it makes for a comfortable stay. The closeness to the airport is also a lovely added bonus and I love the extra bonus in the toilet which you only find in Asian toilets.",August 2017,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Sep 2017,"Bolton, United Kingdom","['22 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",50,"['Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Mr,"As a frequent visitor to Lagos,Nigeria for many years I understand the need to have a secure, relaxing and  comfortable place to lay your head after a day of driving around a very hectic city. I have stayed in all the big international hotels and have never been fully satisfied with the service i recieved for the cost i am being charges. When I located this small boutique hotel in close proximity to the international airport and in a very secure location i was impressed, they offer a friendly service, clean rooms, stable power and an almost one to one service from the management staff. It's now my chosen place to stay in Lagos.",August 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2016,"Lowestoft, United Kingdom","['5 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",40,[]
"Cozy, Private and Secure","When my training trip coincided with two other friends going for a office social event, this very quiet hotel was our choice after we had cozy, and the precautions at the entrance gives a reassuring feeling of privacy and security. The staff are nice and courteous, while the foreign managers are helpful too. The free breakfast is good enough, but you can have as much cereal, tea or coffee you want. Tip: If you're staying as a double occupant however, you need to pay the rate for that room for both occupants to have access to the free breakfast. The difference is worth it, unless your sleep-over guest wouldn't be interested in breakfast before leaving. The hotel spots a nice cool swimming pool with a poolside bar, and the rooms are tastefully furnished. The bathrooms are classic",May 2016,Traveled with friends,"If you do TV, insist on a room with a wider screen: the rooms don't come with same size of TV...",wrote a review Jun 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['9 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
Nice place to live,"Nice place to live. Gym, Recreational Activities, Friendly Staff. But the best above all is food. Guys if you want tasty Indian food, this is the place for you.

A good option to stay,"A small guest house like hotel , is clean and quite comfortable even for long stay option. There is adequate security and good power back up which is a must in Lagos owing to frequent power breakdowns.  The rooms are big in size and well maintained which is a big attraction. There is a decent sized swimming pool in centre of the property which is the only recreation available. The breakfast spread is limited but can request for customized Indian dishes to the chef who obliges, especially for long stayers. Other food options are limited but can go to other local restaurants. Walking is not the preferred option given the security issues.   Atlantic is a good option for travelers who do not want to stay in Victoria Island where there are a number of hotels and guest houses.

Clean and comfortable,"Nice guest house within Lagos reasonably priced. Constant electricity, safe environment and 24hrs free internet service was a plus. Hotel manager and staff were very helpful , breakfast was provided daily. If you love Indian cuisines, you will not be disappointed. Airport shuttle is available but cost about 30$ extra.",January 2015,,,wrote a review Feb 2015,"Owings, MD","['20 contributions', '20 helpful votes']",40,[]
Comfortable stay,"As long as you don't forget its a guest house as it claims not a full fledged hotel, you will be happy. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Pool is small but useful.
