My stay at Starfire hotel,The staff are exceptional in their care for guests however the facility itself is not new and could use an upgrade. The facility has another location across the hotel which is a bit more modern. I stayed there and enjoyed my stay for 7 days.,January 2022,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Nov 2022,,[],30,[]

"Average hotel, clean and basic","Positives: Air con in the room, which is much needed! Our air con was broken so they moved us into another room for the night while they fixed it.   Fridge in room which was handy to keep drinks cold.  Staff were generally very helpful and friendly.  Close to the airport   Local shops and restaurants nearby  Negatives: 1 towel per room, even when 2 people are occupying! I had to ask to speak to the manager to complain and we were eventually given another towel. When I asked why this was their policy I was told it was because people steal the towels! Either way I was not impressed.  When the towels are changed, they are not replaced straight away; on numerous times I was unable to dry my hands or shower and had to wait a while until they brought clean towels.

Average at best,"My stay at BWS was mixed and I'd say the hotel is average at best. The room was clean and decent enough, I enjoyed the buffet breakfast as the food tasted good (except the milk which was obviously heavily diluted with water), the reception staff were attentive and pleasant and overall the hotel was clean. The room had a small fridge which worked fine as well as a mini safe. There's also a small indoor pool and gym.   Unfortunately however the wifi was non functional thus I couldn't use it at all; the air conditioning unit was poor, I complained about this twice and though the technician did show up, that didn't solve the problem and the room temperature therefore fluctuated between warm and semi cold throughout my stay. The staff at the restaurant perhaps could be a bit more",March 2020,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Mar 2020,"Lagos, Nigeria","['747 contributions', '117 helpful votes']",30,[]
BEST WESTERN HOTEL IN ITS TRUE SENSE,"I stayed at the new annex in Victoria Island close to the Bar Beach (as it then was). The beach that used to be across the other side of Ahmadu Bello has been sand-filled and moved many nautical miles in to the Atlantic Ocean. Its so amazing to see new skyscrapers erected in the reclaimed part of Victoria Island. It adds to the glamour of the Hotel as one sees the beautiful scenery from the transparent elevators and also from the room. I also like the in-built swimming pool on the second floor. The restaurant offers very sumptuous but very affordable meals including continental, African and special dishes.

COMFORTABLE HOTEL,Best Western Starfire  is a nice comfortable hotel located in a very quiet part of Ikeja and close proximity to the airport. The hotel standard is as you would expect from an international chain. it met all my expectations. My only disappointment  was my inability to use the swimming pool as it was undergoing maintenance during the period of my stay.

Dump broom cupboard for a room,"I stayed at this hotel because it’s close to the airport. One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in comparable only to SPEKE hotel in Uganda.  The staff seemed more concern with taking a payment from me before even showing me the room. The room was small and smelled of dump. The bed sheets had clearly not been changed and I had to get the receptionist to send in clean sheets.  For $70, this was a total rip off. I would be unhappy paying $20 for that room.

"Near the airport, but........","We spent a night here because we were catching an early flight the next morning. The room was a bit cramped. The bed was a king size but was very uncomfortable. The mattress was very hard and high. Bathroom cleanliness clearly should be looked into. Not much for toiletries. It seemed the room we had was right over the restaurant, as for a long time after we went to bed there was the constant din of cutlery being moved around. We were woken up by the strong smell of cooking early in the morning. Even though, I specifically asked for a quiet room, this was what we got. I made several long distance phone calls before we arrived regarding the room and transportation to and from the airport. But this did not seem to have helped.

Good stay,"The place is in a safe area you could walk around at night , the rooms are okay and the hotel is near the airport. The staff are really helpful, polite and kind. The pool is open for use 24/7 it helps because of the heat, you can use the gym too if you wish to. Their food is okay and there are a great deal of restaurants nearby (Dominos, Yellow Chilli , The place and a couple of others)  There is a good relaxing area near the pool or outside the main entrance .  My only pain was the WiFi, it was on and off at times especially when i really needed it.

Home away from Home,"I am Canadian, and have lived in West Africa for the past 2 years so small things like wifi that is not always 100% perfect, lights going off for a few minutes until the back up generator comes on, or other minor inconveniences, don't phase me . In this case I was looking for a longer term stay (1 month +) with convenient location to my office at an affordable price. I was very happy with my stay and could happily have lived at the hotel for the long term. The rooms are comfortable, the restaurant had a full menu with all items available on it (not always the case in Africa!) and an accommodating chef who was happy to add vegetables to my meal when I asked for them. There is also a nice poolside area to sit and relax or have a bite to eat.

Very Disappointing,"I chose the Best Western as although it is a budget brand you can usually rely on a level of quality. Unfortunately this is not true at the Starfire. I stayed for two nights.   My room was very small however this is not unusual in budget hotels. It did have possibly the smallest window I have ever seen in a hotel. This was compounded by the fact that the circuit breaker to my room tripped out approximately every 2 hours throughout my stay. I would then have to call reception for it to be fixed.   On my return from business on the second day around 4pm my room had still not been made up. Apparently the electronic key I had was the only one available so they couldn't do it while I was out.

Pool closed,"In the heat of lagos relaxing in a pool was my motivation for booking the hotel.

Suggestions, please tell travelers online that your hotel is under renovations or at least offer an alternative close enough since there are other hotels in the vicinity.

"""We try harder...mostly""","I have stayed here several times, and while the  Starfire is expensive by most standards, not really by Lagos's. It would be, at best, a 3-star by any international standard, but they do at least try hard. Management is pleasant and present, and staff are mostly helpful (although they are occasionally slow, absent and/or dismissive). Rooms are patchy too, literally...though not very old, the shoddy (Chinese ?) workmanship and fittings have not worn well. I had a maintenance issue which was well attended to. Be warned, the Nigerian taste in mattresses is super-firm. I see another review moans about the towels - they have improved recently. The pool area is nice enough. WiFi is fairly good. Food is adequate, but mostly steeply priced (a steak is around US$50).

Bad Choice for the Buck!,"We were initially excited that there was a BW hotel in Nigeria and expected the quality of service we have typically received in the States but were shocked upon arrival.  1. After a 13 hour flight, we were told to wait (about 45 minutes) in the lobby because they could only find 1 of 2 reservations that we made.  2. The rooms they finally got us into was not fully ready, the bath was not running hot water and the faucet was broken. The internet and power was sporadic.  3. On two occasions (in one day) we found large live roaches in both bathrooms.  4. At check out they would not accept our Amex which was used to book the reservation. They would not accept $$$ we had stating they were printed before 2006 (don't ask because I still dont get it).

I was pleasantly surprised as I have driven past this hotel several times and did not realise what a gem it is. My room was very large and  very comfortable although I had issues getting hot water to have a shower.

Safe,"A real budget hotel.  The highest point goes to its location: Ikeja GRA nice with a perception of safety and really close to the airport. For these reasons only I may return.

Modernised Hotel,"I have stayed at the Starfire when travelling in and out of Lagos for work for over three years now. It has come a long way since my first stay. It now has a best Western franchise and it is of a good standard for Lagos. The Starfire is not a large hotel, it has a personal feel to it, the service is very good, The rooms have everything you would require, but the standard of finish is poor when closely looked at, i.e paint work, tiles and grouting, ,wiring, etc but it is getting better.  The menu has been upgraded, but do not expect the same standard of food as you would get in a modern European hotel, breakfast can be unappetising.

Decent Hotel;Good staff,"Stayed over night for a business trip.A bit costly on world standards, but I guess that's the way Lagos is. Service was very good.No elevators was a minus point. Didn't face any power cuts.Only problem was I couldn't keep the AC running in the room,as the power operated with the chip of the Key card.So once you are back from heat, it takes some time for the AC to cool down.

A true Staircase hotel . . .,"This Best Western hotel in Lagos has a wrong name. It should be Stairfire – not Starfire.   Hmm . . . Where to start? The Stairfire hotel is located within a good looking resort place with a nice and somewhat spacious rooms and a friendly staff. Close to the international and local airport in Lagos and a good system with complimentary pickup for a driver who deserves tip! It’s a fairly new hotel, so it looks nice and inviting.  BUT: This hotel should be named STAIRfire – as there are no elevators, and the guests have to carry their luggage up and down stairs – if there is no one to help . . . So, physically challenged people simply need to find another hotel. The complimentary internet access in the rooms is so-so – get a cable if you need a reliable connection.
