Amazing Restaurant,"I'm usually not crazy about hotel food but La Cour has really good food. The rooms are not great, the beds are hard, I know because I have stayed in over four rooms. I get the African vibe they are going for but being an African, I don't like it. The food on the other hand is just so good. It is one of my favourite places to eat in Lagos.",October 2016,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Nov 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['39 contributions', '12 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_20', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
Comfortable stay,"Peaceful and tranquil hotel in hot Ikoyi, the food is pretty average not a huge variety, breakfast was the same everyday. The staff are very welcoming  and friendly  always willing to assist. Motel look and feel - the rooms are dark not alot of natural light coming in.",April 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review May 2016,Midrand,['1 contribution'],30,[]
Cool and Quiet,"Spent a night at this place and it was a cool and quiet place. previously, I had been here for a two day event and it could wait to come lay over. But have been back there for drinks a few times. So, I had this event in Ikoyi and wanted to stay close to the venue of the event. Room was neat and all amenities worked well. Would recommend anytime for a business traveler or resident desiring a quiet time to reconnect or spend quality time with a loved one",March 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['102 contributions', '28 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
Horrible place,Rooms smell. Sheets and towels smell. It should be called a motel or inn and not a hotel. The internet does not work. Breakfast is yorgot and tea really crapy. Hotel environment unkempt and dirty. I would say put ur money somewhere else. Checked out at first daylight,February 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2016,"Sault Ste.

Amazing Staff,"I stayed at this hotel because it is the most secluded hotel in this part Ikoyi. I really like my privacy and this hotel is top notch. The staff are very helpful and kind and also very discreet. I also like the restaurant, the barracuda was lovely.",January 2015,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Mar 2015,"Lagos, Nigeria","['39 contributions', '12 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
Basic with a motel-like feel,"I've stayed here on a number of occasions and not been disappointed. It's a very basic hotel by international standards and has the feel of a 60s hotel or good US motel (the decor isn't that old though!). Don't be too put off though, if it's basic hospitality in a clean environment then this will do.  Staff are friendly and service is okay. Food in the restaurant is pretty straight forward but good.",July 2014,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jan 2015,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['33 contributions', '16 helpful votes']",30,[]
My experience and maybe not what you go through,"Checked in for a few days when moving to lagos. invisible staff, unkempt and broken gym and nothing else on offer.  They do have a pool and even a hidden jacuzzi but jump at your own peril. The breakfast is shabby and options limited. The bar is s further bore - something you'd typically expect to be active to keep you going in a city where you really can't walk out for a drink. Can improve significantly. The lady at the reception on the night shift is perpetually in another world or on her personal phone. I had a terrible and extremely uninviting stay.",June 2014,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jun 2014,"Mumbai, India","['40 contributions', '24 helpful votes']",10,[]
Pretty good by Nigerian standards,"This place is pretty good. Ok, it's a rip off at around $250-a-night but in Lagos what do you expect? The service is pretty friendly and the gardens around the compound are very relaxing. The rooms are clean and comfortable, although several times I've had problems with the plumbing, either the shower or toilet or both don't work. To be fair the staff have always fixed it or moved me rooms. The restaurant does decent food and breakfast is ok: fresh fruit, cheese, bread, cereal and eggs if you pay extra. They have a very basic gym. I'd stay here again just because the standard is so poor in Lagos.",January 2013,Traveled solo,,wrote a review May 2013,"London, United Kingdom","['50 contributions', '51 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_20', 'Rooms bubble_30', 'Location bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"
