Valentine Mishap...,Took awhile to get checked in. The Porter took us up to a room that sank of cigarette smoke and weed. They had sprayed profuse amounts of air freshener in an attempt to mask the smell. It didn't work and both smells would either make you nauseous or give one a headache. I asked for another room...i wasn't happy when there wasn't one in my range available (admittedly it was vals weekend) as they tried to arm twist me to paying for an upgrade. I refused and asked for a refund. The pleasant manager calmed me down and asked me to hold on. I went to have a pleasant meal in their restaurant. Luckily they made up another room for us. It didn't smell as bad. But in a rush...they forgot our bottled water and extra towel.  Twas a nuisance. Later we went to the pool for drinks...i was,February 2021,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Feb 2021,London,"['5 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",30,[]
Okerentie,The hotel is nice and very spacious. Had my 25th wedding anniversary there. Good service and good attention to general hygiene given the current covid pandemic. They really made us feel welcome. They decorated our room with rose petals at no extra cost at my request.  The Salma restaurant is a good place to eat.,November 2020,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Nov 2020,,['2 contributions'],40,[]

Average,"The service was top notch...friendly staff and rooms are clean. Breakfast has limited options. I paid for a suite and find there was no TV in the room annoying as the kids took the only TV in the sitting room, spent my days looking up the ceiling.   Safe was broken down and towels are worn out. I ll hesitate going back.",December 2019,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Jan 2020,,['5 contributions'],30,[]

Nice apartments,"We found the apartments clean and well maintained. The staff were incredibly polite and helpful, and would do their best to accommodate our requests. I believe an iron and an ironing board in the rooms, will complete the experience. Parking could be a challenge because of the limited ground space. The breakfast buffet was enjoyable and more than adequate. Overall we had a good time and this could become of my favorite places.",December 2018,Traveled as a couple,Rooms facing the bay have better views and rooms on the higher floors are quieter,wrote a review Jan 2019,"Lagos, Nigeria","['514 contributions', '49 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
Great place,The General Manager here is just excellent and his staff and crew follow up to the standards he sets. It's a great place with a gym next door and you have mall close by too. There is also banks and a  club near by not to mention the resturant 100 meters next door. It's a great location,December 2017,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Jun 2018,,"['10 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]

Decent!,facilities that was not included in the room was electric kettle and clothing iron. We had to request for a clothing iron everyday from the front desk and was given limited time to use it because other guests staying at the property needed to use it. Please note they only have 2 Irons available for all guests staying in the property to use.   The breakfast did not exceed my expectations and it was very bland. I will like to suggest they should label the food for breakfast on the trays. guests with allergies will be aware of what the ingredient entails. On one occasion i thought i was eating puff puff but the taste made me realize i was eating akara which would have been prevented if it was labelled.   The staff service was friendly and attentive.

Home away from home,Travel frequently to Lagos on duty and stay longer periods 3-4 weeks. Found this hotel by chance walking in to look at the rooms as I didnâ€™t like many other hotels with big names))). GM Mr Bernard was very friendly to show me around and I decided to stay at the hotel. From the very beginning staff made my stay most enjoyable. Resolved all issues fast and to my satisfaction. All staff is very friendly. Hotel provides airport transfer which is safe. On hotel compound there is a guy with good equipment  and a cosy restaurant Cactus. The swimming pool is absolutely worth spending your time.  To top all that location of the hotel is unbeatable with good security.  As for rooms they are very spacious and just the perfect match for longer stays. One really feels like at home.,December 2017,,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"St. Petersburg, Russia","['5 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",50,[]
our second home .....,"my husband and I have been staying at this property since April (me on and off). We have a suite, which consists of 2 rooms. There is a small kitchen (only a microwave and a small frig, sink and cabinet space) which I am able to prepare snacks and some meals (with the help of my crockpot). The room is a little ""dated"" could use a remodel. The hotel is in the process of remodeling the pool area, lobby and restaurant. There is a ""gym"" (proflex) which is 2 doors down from the hotel property. There is also a separate restaurant called ""Cactus"" which is popular with the expats and locals. They serve breakfast, lunch, dinner, beer and wine. The hotel property is secure in it's own compound. The generator goes on and off more than I would care for, but this is Lagos! They offer laundry",April 2017,,,wrote a review Oct 2017,"Lagos, Nigeria","['198 contributions', '96 helpful votes']",50,[]
Potter's 10th Anniversary trip,"Although not very well known, this hotel is just beautiful. The suites are so large and clean, you'd surely want to forget the big names. The price, location and great view of the Atlantic makes this the place to relax in the heart of the business centre of Lagos. Forget the big names and give this place a try. It's currently undergoing a renovation of the ground floors and the pool which may lead to some noise occasionally but the value here is great.",August 2017,,,wrote a review Aug 2017,"Lagos, Nigeria","['34 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",40,[]

Good get away from home!,"This hotel boasts of very clean, well lit up and modern rooms. Very spacious i must add. I enjoyed each night because the bed and the pillows made for a great night's rest. The pillows were very comfortable to say the least! You would think that being in VI would make it a noisy place but the serenity of the environment is quite commendable.

Maroko Bayshore Suites have huge suites at great prices.,"I needed to stay in Lagos for 10 days and wanted to have a large room without paying the usual 5 star prices. I was recommended this place.   It is very comfortable, not glitzy but functional. Staff are very warm, polite and helpful. The daily laundry service and breakfast is an added bonus  The view from the Executive Suites is amazing.
