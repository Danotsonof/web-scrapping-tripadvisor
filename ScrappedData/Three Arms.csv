Standard hotel nothing special,"We stayed here with my family for 10 days. The welcome was nice but the first disappointment was the rooms. We had booked 2 rooms exactly the same price and discription. We got 2 rooms next to each other, one of which was large good size clean room and the second was quite small and problems with the door. We asked about this from the reception and they basically said we got what we paid for. We also had 1 set of towels in each room but we got this sorted after the first hiccup.  Next disappointment was at breakfast. We booked the rooms to include breakfast but the staff claimed we had 1 breakfast booked per room, so we would need to pay if we would like breakfast for all. I checked our reservation again and of course it included breakfat for all 4 of us because it would be",October 2018,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Feb 2019,"Bedford, United Kingdom","['61 contributions', '35 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Rooms bubble_20', 'Service bubble_40']"
Bye Bye Three Arms,"Let me keep it short - This has been my choice hotel in Lagos for at least the last 3 years. It's rates are relatively ok, the location is convenient and surroundings nice. If am not staying at this hotel once am in Lagos it is because I have been able to secure a 5 star hotel at a great bargain. My stay in this hotel this month has made me finally realize that its time I commence a hunt for another mid-scale hotel. The hotel facilities are crumbling, staff service barely average, their cost for food outrageous. They had the audacity to call a selection of 3 meals a BUFFET and charge an exorbitant cost. This was the last straw.

Nice facility that is very bad kept.,"The hotel has potential. Great location, friendly staff. But it needs renovation, a touch of planned decoration and redesign. The lobby might trick you as it's nice and clean. But not the rooms. And not the bathrooms. I don't want to ruin the business completely so I am not posting any pictures.

I loved my stay! Definitely going back,"Wow, where do I begin? Three arms was amazing!  I stayed a total of 16 nights (09/12/2017 - 26/12/2017) - longest I've ever stayed at a hotel. The staff were very friendly, it was clean, the service was great. Honestly I have no complaints. Three Arms is located in a lovely serene estate in Ikoyi. Easy access to pretty much the Island and the mainland. I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it 100%. Well done to all the staff! You all are doing an amazing job.

Poor Service,"I booked this hotel via Expedia on the basis of the positive reviews.  I contacted the hotel by e-mail to find out about visa paperwork and to book an airport shuttle.  They didn't respond to four e-mails I sent them, though I was accidently copied into one e-mail from the manager (presumably) telling a member of reservation staff not to assist me with paperwork and to make airport shuttle info clearer to guests!  Given the lack of professionalism and poor service, I cancelled my booking.",November 2017,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"Melbourne, Australia","['387 contributions', '225 helpful votes']",20,[]

A real treasure in Lagos,I have had several dinners at the restaurant at the Three Arms Hotel and it was always a wonderful experience. So my wife and I decided to spend a weekend away from the hustle and bustle of Lagos at the hotel. I think the greatest secret to Three Arms success is its staff. They are ever so courteous and polite and will attend to all your needs. Mr Niyi was exceptional and made our stay fabulous. No complaints whatsoever and highly recommended.,April 2016,,,wrote a review May 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['4 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
Three Arms: My Nigerian Family!,"As an veteran CNN correspondent and international communications consultant, I often travel to Nigeria to serve some of my corporate clients.  I have had the pleasure of staying at the Three Arms for more than four weeks at a stretch during 2014 and again for a week in 2015.   The hotel is small and cozy which makes for a very intimate, friendly experience.  You are not just one customer amidst a crowd, but one of the family.    During my stay, I availed myself of the pool, the gym, the laundry service and most of all of the professional and gracious hospitality of the staff.   I can honestly say that the care with which my tasty meals were prepared, my dresses were ironed, and my business document printing was handled, was on par with any five star hotel in which I have stayed.",July 2015,,,wrote a review Mar 2016,"Dublin, Ireland","['50 contributions', '18 helpful votes']",50,[]
"'Good Wifi and Neat Environment""","My stay at the Three arms Hotel was pleasant. Interestingly internet was perfect both day and night, staff are well behaved and the environs are always neat and tidy. I would highly recommend to friends and family within and outside Nigeria.

Pleasant Stay,"I traveled to Lagos for a short business trip and needed a moderately priced hotel in Ikoyi.I called a friend who referred me to Three Arms.True to What my friend told me,the price was surprisingly affordable given the class of property.Also their service was great ,rooms were clean and I liked the fact that it located in a quite environment.",January 2016,,,wrote a review Feb 2016,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
Excellent value,"Located inside a housing estate built on reclaimed land it's just the ideal place if you are looking for a quite stay, the pictures do not do justice to the property, as the place is small cozy and almost like your own bungalow. The rooms are just right in size the decor is sensible wood and add to the feeling of a cozy room. Staff is friendly and efficient the food is nothing to write about but also nothing to complain about. The one aspect that stands above all is the value for money.....for what one pays you get a lot back",March 2015,,,wrote a review Mar 2015,"Pune, India","['67 contributions', '34 helpful votes']",50,[]
Unbelievable for Lagos!,"This is a really nice and well presented and kept hotel in Lagos. The rooms are clean and have the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on in Nigeria! It's peaceful, but that comes with the only draw back for me.... The location. You have to be readily mobile as you can't just step out to hail a cab.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool looked so inviting, I was kicking myself for not taking my swimsuit (as I wasn't expecting such an amazing facility).   Food is a bit too expensive in my opinion though.  I love the place and certainly would be staying there in my trips to Lagos.  Well done y'all!

Very good hotel but boring neighbourhood,"In Lagos where good hotels are very expensive, Three Arms is one of the very few which maintains a good price-benefit ratio.  That was the reason I chose to stay here on my first visit to Lagos, but I moved out after a couple of days because it is located inside a residential estate where you can do nothing without your own means of transport.  It costs something like 20 dollars in a taxi every time you want to go out, and there is no other choice of transport whatsoever.  I think it is an excellent choice for the business traveller who doesn't need to worry about daily expenses.",October 2013,,,wrote a review Mar 2014,"Tokyo, Japan","['70 contributions', '44 helpful votes']",40,[]
Rare Value on Ikoyi,"We stayed a week at the Three Arms while flat hunting in Lagos and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel given the modest price tag (relative to other Lagos hotels).  The rooms are well decorated with warm tones and spacious enough for two to stay comfortably for more than a couple days. The rooms are kept clean and fairly well serviced. The staff are also quite friendly and helpful, which is a touch often missing from other hotels in Nigeria. Finally, if you're doing business on the Islands, the location is fairly central and it's easy to get onto the mainland as well.  All in all, Three Arms is a great find and worth the money for those in Lagos on business.",August 2013,,,wrote a review Oct 2013,"Lagos, Nigeria","['29 contributions', '46 helpful votes']",40,[]

Great Location and service,"We were on a small business trip to Lagos for three days and were looking for a decent hotel and a decent price. We were very happy with the location and the service that we received at the Three Arms Hotel. Very safe and secure hotel with gym, pool etc for guests. Rooms were all good. I would definitely recommend this hotel to our business travels who don't want to pay the crazy high rates of some of the other Lagos hotels. The service of the staff was also first class.

Charming boutique hotel!,"I've stayed at The Three Arms twice (May 2012 & Dec 2012), and both trips were really good. I'm planning a 3rd stay there very soon. The staff are helpful & friendly, the rooms are elegant & spacious, there's free wifi in the communal areas, the meals are tasty, and there was no fight for a space by the pool. But better still, it's a peaceful little haven away from the normal chaos. If I had to point out a flaw, it would be regarding maintenance...they need to be more proactive in changing broken/damaged amenities. However, overall the place is a little gem & they seem to improve with each stay! Would definitely recommend it.",December 2012,,,wrote a review May 2013,"London, United Kingdom","['1 contribution', '5 helpful votes']",40,[]
Hidden gem in Lagos,"First trip Lagos a city filled with expensive hotel. Not only was the Three Arms much more reasonably priced but the staff truly went above and beyond to make sure I had an excellent experience. The rooms were clean, nice decor, the wifi is strong, the pool area is pleasant, and shockingly the hotel was mostly vacant. The only downside is that its tucked away far from a main road, which actually increases its safety. Their staff knew I was not familiar with Lagos and gave excellent advice for the city and even provided me with a very affordable and trusted driver when mine was not available. Hard to imagine a better value in Lagos.",February 2013,,,wrote a review Feb 2013,"Porto-Novo, Benin","['10 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,[]
Nice experience,"Just like the first review I had never heard of Three Arms and was very skeptical. I no longer trust pictures posted on websites of hotels, it didn't help that when I called they told me their room rate was 20,000N, compared to 28,000N for a hotel close to the airport.  When I arrived at Three Arms, the reception and general ambiance was nice but I was hesitant to get excited until I saw the rooms. As I walked up the grand stairs to my room, they opened my door and low and behold the room was as beautiful as I saw in the pictures. My room was cosy, warm, clean, everything you expect from a hotel!!!  I was only in town for two nights and it was a pleasure.The staff was nice, the restaurant and food was nice.

The best,"It's not that well known, so I was a little skeptical when I booked my first night at the hotel. On arrival I was amazed and astonished. The decor was fantastic. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before in Lagos. It was clean and airy, perfect for the climate. My room was clean and spacious, fully equipped with satellite television and rapid internet. The bathroom had lovely toiletries and the power shower with 3 shower heads was a delight. The hotel had a well equipped gym with a well trained instructor on site. He immediately put me on an appropriate training regimen. There was an appropriately sized swimming pool as well. The food and drinks were also exceptional. After my stay there, I signed up for the gym and attended several of their networking nights on Fridays.
