Not Marriott standard,"For sure not Marriott standard. Will never go there again. The staff is very friendly and at least tries their best to help. Breakfast is sometimes a la cart and sometimes not.

Not up to former Protea standards,"Visiting a protea in Nigeria used to be a pleasure but since its relationship with Marriot quality of certain aspects has declined although not yet to the level of the former Sheraton in Abuja. Rooms are OK and the beds up to usual Sheraton standard. Pool is nice and the location facing the ocean pleasant if you have a room with a view. Access to the hotel is via a road in pretty poor shape.. Gym is small with a couple of treadmills, a gym machine, couple of bikes and a manual elliptical trainer. For me the pleasure of a Protea was its fantastic breakfast buffet. Sad to report this is no longer available with a very poor selection, instant coffee only, no decent meats or cheese, no pastries . Overall very disappointing for N14,00 ($30).. Internet connectivity just about OK..",January 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jan 2023,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","['63 contributions', '18 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30']"
CAUTION CORRUPT HOTEL!,"By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.  I booked my hotel at the official Marriott website using my points.  Just three days before I arrived I received an email from Marriott welcoming me to the hotel.  However, when I arrived, at check-in, I was informed by the front desk agent (Grace) that Marriott points were not accepted at the hotel, but that they would be willing to offer me a special rate for each night.  I had no prior notice, they didn’t notify me by email or any other means, but they refused to accept my reservation that was guaranteed by Marriott.  After discussing it with the manager on duty (Ms. Tokunbo), we agreed on a rate, and they agreed to return my points back to my Marriott account.  However, they did not accept international credit cards (their",September 2022,,,wrote a review Sep 2022,"Madrid, Spain","['149 contributions', '15 helpful votes']",10,"['Location bubble_10', 'Service bubble_10', 'Sleep Quality bubble_20']"
Bad experience and poor communication,"Our stay at Protea Hotel was not nice. The staff are rude. We made payments for 2 nights with breakfast inclusive. And I was told that I will be given a refund for not eating breakfast the morning I was checking out by the front desk officer. She even requested for my account details which I provided immediately only for them to turn around to say I don't have a refund. If Protea was not giving me a refund, they should have advice me to take my breakfast or forfeit the refund, which they did not say. Before I checked out. I have evidence of the WhatsApp number giving to me to send in the account details, and it was acknowledged. They have integrity issues, no transparent communication.  This is not a good experience for a first visit.",June 2022,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Jun 2022,,['1 contribution'],10,[]

I had the worst experience  and secondly, I have tried to reach them on several occasions  to get some information  about my stay and they have given me the run around.

There are some renovations right now so the only place to dine is in-room or by the pool and with the heat and humidity, poolside can be an ordeal.

"Perfect location, shame about the hotel...","I spent one night at this hotel. Hidden within a maze of winding roads, the hotel is magnificently framed by the sea, complete with crashing waves and cool sea breezes.

The bathroom tub appeared weak and the water in the taps was salty. Internet access is available in the rooms via cable so if you are an iPad user or wireless card user you need to go to the hotel lobby lounge to get wireless access.
