Time at Welcome hotel Lagos,"The hotel lived up to its name. Very welcoming staff and peaceful atmosphere.  Clean environment, dutiful staff members (always having a smile to share) spacious and world class  standard rooms. I lodged in one of the business suites and enjoyed my stay without a doubt. They've got very good  facilities available lfor example clean standard swimming pool, volley ball ground, table tennis etc all in a spacious environment.   Welcome hotel Lagos is where I will love to stay again when I visit Lagos Nigeria. It's the closest hotel to the international airport which comes very handy considering the Lagos traffic!.   You can easily get to the airport from the hotel within 5 mins!   Their food is very tasty, effective security personnel. It's a place you feel safe and secure without",August 2022,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2022,,['1 contribution'],40,[]

quite fine hotel if you need to stay close to the airport for few nights,"fair level of services for reasonable price. Cleaning service guys were not always wearing their face masks covering their nose and mouth - even when cleaning the room, which is not very alright. This could be improved on the side of the hotel. Guests in the restaurant were mostly ignoring face masks, which is the sign of their tolerance and respect towards other guests, on the other hand the hotel staff in restaurant could have reminded guests anytime (as staff were present in the restaurant all the time) but they did not - which is the issue of the hotel (staff doing their job well and keeping guests within limits of appropriate behaviour in interior of the hotel).",January 2022,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Mar 2022,"Bratislava, Slovakia",[],40,[]

HOME IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD,I find this hotel a real home within a stone-throw  neighbourhood of the busiest Airport on the African continent; the Murtala Mohammed International Airport Lagos. Its proximity to the Airport makes it next to impossible for missing flights. The rooms are luxurious and spacious. It's only 2 minutes drive to either the International or Domestic Wing and to MMA 2. The staff are well behaved and smartly dressed.  I also enjoyed dinner and breakfast in the Restaurant.

Everything I need - and more,"I always stay at the Welcome Centre on my regular trips to Lagos. It is about a mile from the airport and close to the main Oshodi-Apapa expressway. The comfortable room I stay in is fairly spacious, with a bath, and with a view of the airport. The staff are always friendly, caring, and above all trustworthy. Cleaning is always done very thoroughly. The bar and restaurant are just fine. There is a well-equipped gym, a really good, large and clean swimming pool (with pool bar), tennis court, volleyball court and a garden. Generator is switched on promptly when NEPA goes off.

Lovely hotel VERY close to Lagos' airports.,"Hotel is very close to Lagos' International and Domestic airports - which makes this a must-stay considering the hectic traffic situation in Lagos. Staff is very friendly and always helpful and check-in and check-out went smooth. I stayed on the 3rd floor and although the wifi can sometimes be finicky, it worked 99% of the time. Rooms and bathrooms are old, but clean and beds hard, but good. Breakfast is somewhat limited and the coffee is not good, but you get interesting breakfast dishes like pizza, rice and stew. Room service is fast and dishes quite tasty - also not expensive.

Certainly not 5 star,"I recently stayed at the Welcome Centre for 3 weeks. The flyer on the table in the dining room claimed that they were a 5 star hotel. I am sorry but I have to disagree. The location is poor with no restaurant or bars in the local area, so you are tied to the hotel. The beds are firm bordering on hard, so be prepared to a firm mattress. The internet was patchy at best and in the last week there was an instance where the system went off completely for 24 hours. I called constantly from room to be told that it was still down. In the evening when I went for my meal, I was told that you could get a connection in the reception or business centre! I had sat all day not knowing this.

I would have rated the hotel a ""very good"" rating if not for the restaurant staff who were not really into hospitability business! In stead of asking the management for the kind of booking, the lady (I guess in charge of the restaurant) was very quick at jummping to a wrong conclusion, and was not even polite.

Amazingly appalling short-stay after missed flight,"Stayed here temporarily after flight got cancelled, just a few hours in which I witnessed very appalling service. Front Desk was rude and terse, understandable, as he was overwhelmed by the throng of rather irate passengers who had been kept waiting at the airport a whole 7 hours after flight was cancelled. But certainly no reason to be rude and aggressive. Simple questions got very rude responses. The hotel lobby had no air conditioning, and with the throng of people, quickly became overwhelmingly hot and very sweaty. The rooms were shabby, the floors felt sticky with poor cleaning. The lift was a hazard by itself, shaking violently with every stop, that large numbers of us opted to use the stairs to the third floor where we had rooms. Restaurant service was appalling.

Everything worked---the internet access, the swimming pool, the gym, the elevator, warm water, the TV, the safe and the phone system. I had previously stayed at a different hotel  a month earlier (De Renaisance, also at Ikeja, Lagos) where most of those conveniences did not work, though they were aggressively advertised. A few negative experiences that I had must also be mentioned. The front desk could not find my reservation, though I provided them",September 2011,,,wrote a review Sep 2011,"Nashville, Tennessee","['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]
Even better second time round....,"This was my 2nd visit to this hotel, I stayed here for 3 nights this summer holiday. I really like this hotel ...i think it has everything I want....1) direct online booking...I was able to reserve on their website and securely pay through paypal.  2) friendly staff (e.g one of the receptionists 'Tonya' remembered me from an earlier visit and welcomed me back). it did make me feel good. 3) very clean hotel...possibly the cleanest hotel i know in Lagos...4) hearty buffet breakfast which is complimentary....5) Also complimentary high speed internet and by the way my laptop connected straight away from saved memory. I can say their food has also improved. now if the hotel would also accept american express and mastercard, i would be soo happy. i dont like using my Visa credit card",May 2011,,,wrote a review Jul 2011,Lagos,"['9 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",50,[]
Good Quality Hotel,"Stayed here for two weeks whilst on a business trip and overall, was very impressed. The rooms are of a good size, with a massive double bed, satellite tv (not many channels worked though) and wireless internet connection. The cleanliness was good and free bottles of water were placed in the room each day.  There is a decent sized swimming pool/sun bathing area and a gym, plus two bars which tended to be quiet but nice enough to relax with a beer.  The reception staff/ porters were all very pleasant and helpful and in this regard the hotel did live upto its name!  The hotel is all non-smoking, which i dont mind at all. However if you are a smoker like me i would recommend getting a room on the 4th floor, as you then have easy access to the bar (with a balcony you can smoke on)",May 2011,,,wrote a review Jun 2011,norwich,"['7 contributions', '12 helpful votes']",40,[]
"Needed a room for 1 night, glad I chose this hotel","I arrived in Lagos, Nigeria for tourism on January 20 on my way to Benin City. Since my flight to Benin City didn't leave until the 21st, I decided to stay at this hotel and  i'm glad I did! The decor was very nice and my room was super clean. The lighting was a little dim which was the only negative. I ordered food from the restaurant and I have to say the Jayloff rice was the best I'd ever had!! The security was tight and I'd recommend this hotel to a female travelling alone.",January 2011,,,wrote a review Feb 2011,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","['2 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",40,[]

"Nothing fancy, but ticks all the right boxes.","I booked this hotel with a little trepidation but was pleasantly surprised. It's a good, standard hotel. Nothing fancy, but definitely not bad. It's quite close to the airport (believe me, that's a good thing in lagos) and getting there was quite straight forward.   Check in was lousy. I'd booked and paid via expedia only to arrive and be told they had no reservation for me. i was kept waiting in the lobby for nearly two hours while they sorted out the mess. although the exterior and the lobby all looked very good, I was a little worried my stay would be just as lousy as the check in, but that wasnt the case at all. From then onwards, everything ran smoothly.   The room was large and spacious with a firm, king-sized bed. Bathroom was nice with really good towels and the water",September 2010,,,wrote a review Oct 2010,"Woodbridge, Canada","['62 contributions', '23 helpful votes']",30,[]
great transit hotel,"I travel regurlary to Lagos for work. The airport car hire service recommended the hotel to me. I'm grateful they recommended it to me. It is actually very close to the airport and is less expensive than Sheraton, Planet One or Protea in the Ikeja area. It looked secure and very clean. checking in was very quick unlike what I am used to in other hotels. Rooms were large, clean and ACs were quiet. Food is okay. All the other facilites are kept clean and the gym machines were all working well. Finally its great to stay in a place where the gift shop has reasonable prices :)",July 2010,,,wrote a review Sep 2010,Lagos,"['9 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",50,[]

Scrubsciously Clean - Typical Nigerian Service,"I was (un)lucky enough to have to spend 4 weeks in Nigeria, working for a Nigerian Company.  The hotel provided by my employer was The Welcome Centre. On arrival I was most impressed with the modern decor, and security was very very strict, something which is reassuring, given that the hotel is located in a very dangerous and run down part of Lagos.   The hotel itself is located approximately 15 mins from the International Airport Terminal, though be warned, at rush hour it will take you between 1 and 2 hours to get here, the traffic in this part of the world is like nothing you have ever seen.  The entire hotel is non smoking, which is quite refreshing and very modern and clean. The rooms are immaculate, lovely clean beds, trustworthy housekeeping staff and a digital safe and",July 2010,,,wrote a review Jul 2010,"Northwich, United Kingdom","['95 contributions', '91 helpful votes']",40,[]
"COLD WATER, INSTANT COFFEE AND ALL FOR $175 US A NIGHT!",I stayed in this hotel following a tough filming trip on Nigeria's Jos Plateau in June 2010. When will hotels like this offer a decent service when they charge such big prices - on arrival they told me my credit card had been refused. I had made security arrangements to have the card used in Nigeria and after 35 minutes at reception they discovered it was actually their equipment at fault. The bedroom was good but cold water for $175 a night???I think not. At breakfast I was offered sachets of instant coffee - sorry to nail the point guys but $1 7 5 US!!! get real and offer business people a proper service and we might actually stay there...needless to say the place seemed deserted when I was there.,June 2010,,,wrote a review Jun 2010,London,"['67 contributions', '33 helpful votes']",20,[]

Excellent location for the International Airport,"This hotel is perfectly positioned for access to the International Airport although, as it is on a dual carriageway access to it from the International Airport would not be so easy. I stayed in Room 216 and this was clean and presentable, but not as large as I would have expected. It is a NON SMOKING hotel. Note if you smoke then you will have to do so in the car park. But as a non smoker I found the lack of 'smokers smell' in the bed room a nice surprise. Reception was in a large atrium the height of the hotel and lifts work well. There is a flat screen TV in the room, with Nigerian and South African TV chanels, and International news channels. Electricity was constant, and backup generators started promptly once there were power cuts. There is a shower in the room with high",January 2010,,,wrote a review Jan 2010,Hereford UK,"['127 contributions', '109 helpful votes']",40,[]
Finally a 5* Hotel in Lagos!,"We spent a few nights at this hotel with our 9 year old and ten month old baby. The junior suite was spacious enough and the bed big enough to contain all four of us! I am so fussy about cleanliness and would not even let my baby on the floor to play in some hotels, but at Welcome I was happy for her to play outside by the pool, crawl to her hearts content in the hotel suite and by the pool. This was my husband's first trip to Africa and I felt proud that there was such a place that didn't let me down. The staff were friendly and polite. My 9 year old loved the poolarea, went swimming and played table tennis and table football. We all had a great time! The question is will the place still remain looking as clean and staff as professional after a couple of years? We hope so as it",August 2009,,,wrote a review Aug 2009,London,"['5 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
Best near airport,"Good place to stay if need to get to airport quickly as only 5 minutes away but ,like verything else in Lagos,overpriced at around £160. Very nice roomy clean room, nice bar, seems popular with air crews. Restaurant service though was abominable as was food. so better to go out to eat. Took over an hour to get a simple pizza . Wireless very  slow. Great that this was the only hotel of four that I stayed at on this trip that actually took credit cards and had a machine that worked! Top marks for that.",June 2009,,,wrote a review Jul 2009,UK,"['31 contributions', '23 helpful votes']",30,[]

Actually quite good...................,A friend of mine put me up here for a couple of nights. Its was actually very good. I liked it. Its a new place so my room still felt fresh and breezy. It was also really clean and secure. The hotel is striking and it was a nice location for my friends and I to catch up...kicking it at the bar or pool. Although I was unhappy they hadnt finished constructing tennis court and stage before they opened the hotel. I stayed a couple of nights and it was quite good.  A bit pricey but I didnt pay so I wont complain ;),November 2008,,,wrote a review Dec 2008,Abuja,['1 contribution'],40,[]
