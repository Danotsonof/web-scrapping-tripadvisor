Avoid rude receptionist,Decided on a family day out for the kids to swim eat and enjoy. We even sent message before gettting there only to be told we cannot swim as its only for lodgers. We were prepared to pay for a room just so they could swim only to be told we only have one hour. Firstly I suggest you get a new receptionist who can actually talk to people with respect and not like she is being forced to come to work. We requested to see the manager she said they are not here ok what of supervisor they are also not here all conveniently in meetings. Her whole attitude was off and totally unwelcoming.  The women by the bar came to apologise and the security man however it is not for them to do so.  You want customers but it seems your receptionist will finish you.,December 2022,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Dec 2022,,"['15 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",10,[]
LANDSCAPE/HOTEL GROUNDS BEAUTIFUL,Landscape and Hotel grounds beautiful. Pool extremely wonderful. Pool extremely wonderful. Area nice. Easy to find from airport.

Dr Ken,"Staying in this hotel reminded me that the Map is not the territory. The words are not the things it is describing. I paid a total of 38,000 Naira for a night and we stayed for three days in what they call a suit and promised on phone that it is big enough for a family of five. It turned out to be a small room packaged as a suit and a supplement dirty bedding had to be supplied to accommodate my infant.  They also promised that the money covers breakfast but I was surprised to be given an embarrassing bill for every breakfast given to all except me. The hotel is also dirty and not clean to my taste for such amount a night. It is an old place, strategically good to access Ikeja but it is simply a bad place for the amount they charge. The management is also professionally",May 2018,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Aug 2018,"London, United Kingdom","['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",10,[]
Serene,"It was a wonderful taste of serenity. Loved the environment, it's a touch of nature, loved the staff, loved the room, the 24hrs power supply, the continuous flow of hot water and cold AC. I loved the swimming pool and the Apple tree. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It's a memory to behold.",February 2017,Traveled as a couple,Quiet but well furnished room.

Serene Environment,"The hotel's location is nice. Strategic to all parts of Ikeja, and quite secure too. However, it is awkward that the main gate to the primary street (Abel Oreniyi) is closed around 8pm and then you have to circumvent by stopping before it to use Ajanaku Street all the way down before connecting Oroleye Crescent. Quite a merry-go-round for the unwary traveler. The rooms are nice; I didn't really get the difference between the Standard and Deluxe Rooms, both of which seem of about same size. The Deluxe could use a bigger bed though. Electronics in the room worked, except the desk lamp (I'm suspecting the bulb was burnt) and the emergency lamp above the bed. Power is NOT uninterrupted, but the manual switch-over is quick enough, within 30 seconds of power outage any time of the",February 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Mar 2017,"Lagos, Nigeria","['9 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_30', 'Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40']"
Cute hotel tucked away in oroleye street ikeja,"hotel was a bit difficult to find, no signboard, and street nos was not written boldl on the gate. Inside the hotel, shows some attention was paid to details, rooms are colorful, though a bit small, toilet area was also good, unlike what obtains in many nigerian hotels of its class. staff were efficient and friendly. wifi was good. standby generator was turned on within 90secs of power outage",January 2017,Traveled solo,get multiple wifi logins from the reception if you hve more than 1 device,wrote a review Jan 2017,"Port Harcourt, Rivers, Nigeria","['27 contributions', '28 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
Tranquil environment,"I like the ""green"" theme of the hotel, it has a serene feel to it. It's a small place and a bit hidden, most cabs don't know how to find it, but Uber works. The external environment can be noisy on occasion, mostly from adjacent buildings or club.",September 2016,Traveled solo,"do not stay on the ground floor, too noise from people coming and going at different times of the...",wrote a review Oct 2016,"Houston, Texas","['223 contributions', '20 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50']"
Beautiful,"The Hotel environment is lovely.... beautiful gardens which are well designed and cared for with many nooks and crannies. The perfect place for a wedding as the photos would be magnificent with flower arches, greenery, beautiful backgrounds galore. Business meetings and conference goers would also appreciate the special ambience. Dining can be al fresco in lovely garden surroundings. Even the driveway is impressive as you go through an avenue of greenery arching above you. High quality throughout departments. My only grouch is a personal dislike of the habit of not being automatically given the menu when one is available...being told verbally what there is or being asked what you want... its all in the server's head etc. I like to know the prices of what I am buying upfront...",May 2016,Traveled with friends,suites are good,wrote a review May 2016,"Ilorin, Nigeria","['27 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Pleasant Oasis in Busy Ikeja,"My regular lodgings were fully booked so had to find alternative. Was recommended to Jeromes.  Arrived on a Sunday night after 2100. Welcome friendly, check in quick and bags taken to room. Formalities completed following morning.  Room spacious all amenities working. Power has been an increasing problem in Lagos but premises have generator. Just affects wifi connection.  Breakfast modest fare but fresh and well prepared. Waitrons attentive to requests.  If gardens an issue - most pleasant surroundings with swimming pool.  Only downside - on check out connection to MasterCard unavailable - had to make alternative arrangements.",March 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Mar 2016,"Greater Johannesburg, South Africa","['204 contributions', '87 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Pease like a river... For those in search of a tranquil place!,"If you love nature, and are looking for some peace and quite, away from all the hustles and bustles of a chaotic Lagos metropolitan life, Jeromes garden should suit you perfectly. The room was quite colorful, and the bathroom especially. Never seen a bathroom so colorful in an hotel. The staff are quite nice and happy, the food was well prepared with artistic touch. The garden makes you feel at peace with nature. If you are in Lagos for business or please and you need some peace and quiet, you might just want to stay at Jeromes Garden.",July 2015,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jul 2015,"Lagos, Nigeria","['63 contributions', '37 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
