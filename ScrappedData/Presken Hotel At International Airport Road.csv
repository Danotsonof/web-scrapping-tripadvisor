Good place to stay if you need to be close to Lagos International Airport,"A good and affordable place to stay if you need to be close to the Lagos International Airport (just 10 - 20 min away depending on traffic - but could vary to 40 min in peak traffic hours). Great free wifi. A bit gloomy and dark, but the staff are friendly and very helpful. Free taxi services available to the airport.",March 2017,Traveled on business,Get a room facing east so that the sun can flood into your room in the morning.,wrote a review Mar 2017,"Morelia, Mexico","['29 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",30,"['Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"
Not bad for a short stay.,"This hotel was not of our choosing; we were put up here by an airline that caused us to miss connecting flights out of Lagos. However, it was not a terrible place - though it was, in some respects, an odd place. The lobby was large with a somewhat modern-ish decor.   Overall, the property seemed quite clean and the staff was very cheerful and helpful. Our room and the other one I saw was very clean and spacious. We actually had what I believe was a suite (the ""Little Rock"") as we did have a tiny second half bath and a small triangular sitting area which was separate from the bedroom. The separate sitting area only had one chair, but we weren't in the sitting mood, anyway! And the water supply to the second toilet was not on and hot water was not available in this half bath.
