Tastiest food in Nigeria!,"The hotel although does not have great infrastructure you expect in a good hotel, but is manageable.   I want to talk about food here, I still can't beleive they made butter chicken better tasting than in India originator state of Punjab. Also tasted 'Swallow' a local Nigeria dish, wasn't dissappointed at all.  Highly recommended for Indians and people who like to tasty spicy food besides regular stuff.   10/10 for Food 7/10 for comfort 9/10 for security 8/10 for location",December 2021,Traveled on business,Ample parking space!,wrote a review Feb 2022,"Chennai (Madras), India","['17 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",40,[]
Awesome Stay!,"I had a lovely stay at Smridu's. The owner is amiable and checked on the well-being of his guests. The staff was determined and always cheerful. Different cuisines are served. Some of the Indian guests are unfriendly and rude to the staff. However, the hotel is fantastic and I highly recommend it. I will be returning to Smridu's soon!",August 2018,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2018,,"['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Good Indian Hotel,Its not a luxury hotel but if you are looking for good and clean stay with Indian food then this is the best option. Good service and cooperative staff ready to adjust for your comforts.

Business Visit during April 2017,"Its a small property owned and managed by Indians. Stayed for almost 3 days during my visit to Nigeria. As far as location is concerned it is near by to the Lagos airport, almost 30 mins drive. As far as connectivity to Lagos city is concerned you have to travel almost 1 hour daily. Food was good which was Indian and served to our needs. The rooms were average. There was a pool in the property which was not being used by any guests at that point.",April 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2017,"London, United Kingdom","['48 contributions', '17 helpful votes']",30,"['Rooms bubble_20', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30']"
SMRIDU in Lagos is a refuge & safe haven,"Smridu is ideally suitable for Indian travelers to Lagos which is such a hostile city and most unsafe city. Smridu is located in GRA ( Govt Restricted Area ) which is essentially occupied by military personnels akin to our Catonment areas in India thus relativey safe and under the watchful eye of military ( supposedly ) persons. The property is well maintained with an Indian restaurant and reasonably good Indian restaurant attached to it. It does not have a fancy entrance or arch or well decorated gate etc ( it does not even have a name plate of this hotel on the main entrance gate )  but once inside , you are in safe hands.  The newly revamped rooms are good with some odd problems of hot water etc but these are not big problematic issues. It is fairly priced and the management",May 2016,Traveled on business,Choose in the newly revamped wing.,wrote a review Jun 2016,"Pune, India","['18 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_30', 'Rooms bubble_30', 'Service bubble_50']"
Good hotel managed by Indians near Lagos Airport,"The hotel is located at Ikeja Adekunle Fayuji. Very decent hotel, clean very cost effective and good Indian menu to select from. Being nvery near to the international / domestic airport at Ikeja is another added advantage. You can use this hotel as a transit point if you are planning to catch an onward flight (may be to Port Harcourt, Ghana etc.) The friendly floor managers (Mostly Indians) are there to help you out in case of any emergency. I have been visiting this hotel for last 3 years after every 3 Months frequency as a transit point in Lagos. There is a swimming pool, excellent drinks bar, restaurant, Diesel generator set inside the property. The security is very strong which is a prime requirement in Nigeria (They have CCTV, electrical fences, and is guarded for 24 hrs by",April 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review May 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['85 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
Harrowing experience loosing all belongings in fire,"Stayed in the place in February 2016. On the 4th evening, there was a fire in the wing in which there were 12 rooms due to an electric short circuit. All the rooms were gutted and I could not retrieve any thing from the room after the fire was doused as every bit of my belongings were in ashes. Luckily there were no injuries or burns to anyone except one person who had to bang open the glass door and thus hurt his leg. When the fire was being doused, the hotel owner consoled us and said that he will compensate us, but the only compensation from his side was help in getting emergency certificate in lieu of burnt passport from our High Commission and waiving off the room and food charges.",February 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2016,"Pune, Maharashtra, India","['26 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",10,"['Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"

The owners are very passionate about making their guest's stay as comfortable as possible. The facilities provided like the swimming pool,gym are well maintained.

"All things considered, PDG","First off, there are two hotels of this name, and this review addresses the one at 43 Saka Tinuba Street on Victoria Island.  There's no name on the gate, nor on the building.  Mysterious?  Maybe, but the place is on the level.  It's managed by Indians and mostly serves Indians, which probably explains why there's no need to advertise.  Moreover, the place is a great bargain by Lagos standards, and the rooms are clean and comfortable.  If you want to be close to Lagos Island but aren't made of money, this is a very good choice.  The food is so-so, but they do serve Indian dishes if that appeals, and you're only a 10-minute walk from a big Shoprite on Adeola Odeku.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and my only complaint (luck of the draw) is that my room reeked of tobacco",August 2015,Traveled on business,"Ask if you can see the room first, and check for tobacco odors.",wrote a review Aug 2015,United States,"['31 contributions', '54 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"

"Excellent Service, Great food, Conveniently Located","SMRIDU is a very well managed hotel. The owners personal attention is visible in the excellent service that we received.  The food is amazing and the location is very convenient. They have 3 properties in Lagos, 2 in Ikeja and 1 in VI. This is very helpful as you can choose the property depending on your work.  It also had a pool, 24 hour power supply and a safe environment.  Overall an excellent place",June 2015,,,wrote a review Jun 2015,New Delhi,"['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
Home....away from home!,"This group has around 3 units in Lagos, Nigeria viz. 2 in Ikeja and 1 at Victoria Island.  Facility is owned by Indian entrepreneurs. Place is absolute value for money.   Although a humble abode and is certainly not flashy at all, but offers almost everything an international traveler would need. Right from the food, to lodging facility, to recreation facilities like gym and pool etc, everything is available with absolute cleanliness and safety.   Icing on the cake is friendly yet professional staff.  I fully recommend the place to fellow travelers.",May 2015,,,wrote a review Jun 2015,,"['8 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
Decent board and lodge,"Decent price. In May 2015 cost around 130 US Dollars/day including breakfast, wifi, Gym&Swim. Put in another 25 US dollars daily and your lunch dinner is done. Safe hotel. Completely stockaded from outside. Your suitcase items wouldn't get pilfered. This is one of the major concerns which this hotel is free from. Friendly staff. The staff is pretty helpful. They help out anytime. Great on Indian fare. Not and extensive menu. But whatever they bring out of the kitchen is yummy even Indian masala tea. Polite and soft spoken staff. If you are not satisfied with some service all you have to do is ask. Even the traditional Nigerian kitchen fare is good. Excellent value for money.  And they even pack your lunch to carry it out as you would be having your breakfast.

Excellent management and value for money,Owner has a clear cut intension of giving excellent service. Best for the people who like staying in the clean and noisefree environment. Gym and swimming pool are maintained  at its best level. One can also opt for the in house car service which is little expensive but worth it in lieu of the safety.,November 2014,,,wrote a review Dec 2014,,"['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
Great place for a comfortable stay in Lagos,"It doesnot look like a Hotel. Have around 50 + rooms. A small swimming pool,Gym and good inetnet connectivity avaialble. Rooms in the old block is  bit cramped. New wing rooms are bit spacious. Staff is and service level is good. They serve Multicusine food. Typical Indian cuisne is USP. Good place for a longer stay as one doesnot get the feel of a Hotel and comfort is ok.",December 2013,,,wrote a review Nov 2014,"Chandigarh, Chandigarh, India","['408 contributions', '108 helpful votes']",40,[]
