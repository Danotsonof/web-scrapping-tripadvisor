It‚Äôs was a pretty decent stay,"I came in pretty early in the morning, about 6am and the service was amazing. I stayed in the Burj Khalifa room, I loved it! However, since I didn‚Äôt stay very long I don‚Äôt have a lot more to critique.",September 2023,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Sep 2023,,['1 contribution'],50,[]

magnificent,Always a pleasure staying over at this hotel. One of my best hotels in Lagos any time am staying out.

Tranquility,Very calm ambience and sweet smelling environment. Very clean room with well laid out furniture. Enjoyed the evening treat of small chops and sweet wine. Each room is exquisitely unique with a variety of items uniquely arranged to  make a difference!,January 2023,,Not in a position to speak to this,wrote a review Jan 2023,,['1 contribution'],50,"['Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
A pleasant experience but need to improve on the details,"The place was clean. looked stylish and attractive. Staff where friendly and accommodating.  Food was quite good and reasonably priced. I wish they had more in the way of fresh fruit. They did however provide free finger food and wine at the weekends, which was nice.  Villa monuments needs to do better in terms of details if they wish to be considered 4 star. My bedside lamps where not working. My TV was not properly tuned. The wash linen was not always replaced properly after room service.  They tried. But at that price point they should be doing better.",October 2022,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Nov 2022,,['1 helpful vote'],30,[]
Was Better Before,Very good but was better in the past. Noisy now even during the day (building next door). Was noisy usually only Friday night from the club next door. Suddenly cannot use the conference room without payment?? Service a bit slower than before (response time while making reservations) yet the hotel is still one of the hidden jewels of Lagos.,October 2022,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Oct 2022,,"['5 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",40,[]

Below Expectations,"The Hotel had a very beautiful ambience. I loved the interior designs and artifacts. However, it‚Äôs either most of the staffs aren‚Äôt well trained on hotel service &management or they just lack courtesy. Imagine someone coming into your room to bring your order and can‚Äôt  say good morning. Or the staffs just walk pass you and refuse to greet. Same thing with the janitor..I greeted one of the receptionist and she was too big to answer and when I stated that I just greeted you, she replied Hi, good morning non-challantly. This is the first hotel that I will experience such terrible attitude from the staff. The day we were checking out, the lady at the reception couldn‚Äôt  even greet or ask if we enjoyed our stay. I‚Äôm glad we checked out two days after cos we had to go out to even get",September 2022,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Sep 2022,,['1 contribution'],30,[]
Hidden Jewel,"Great experience. Outstanding as even the most famous hotels in Lagos are mediocre at best. Staff is amazing, rooms are wonderful and we'll kept, food and service is great. Location on VI is also ideal. Simply a 10+ on a scale from 1-10. Prices surprisingly reasonable for value obtained!",April 2022,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2022,"Columbia, Maryland","['41 contributions', '15 helpful votes']",50,[]

Beautiful aesthetic and great service in the heart of Lagos.,"Gotta say, pretty mighty impressed by this place. The room was well done, beautifully decorated to suit the theme, the bathroom was super clean and very well done. Basic amenities and then some provided as well. The food was good albeit on the pricey side - some may say worth it - could be. Staff are very well mannered, very well spoken and happy to assist.   I just honestly hope they maintain this standard and all this goodness isn‚Äôt just because they are new. I‚Äôll definitely be back tho! That‚Äôs for sure. 5 stars all the way. I‚Äôll take pictures next time.",June 2020,,,wrote a review Jun 2020,"Lagos, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],50,[]
