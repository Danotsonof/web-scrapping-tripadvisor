Personal,"The hotel is beautifully tucked in a serene and secure environment in VI. It provides easy access to your business. Service is prompt, professional and courteous staff. The poolside bar is an ideal meeting place  with friends and love ones to unwind till dawn, live grills and Music",April 2018,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Apr 2018,,['26 contributions'],50,[]
Sweet place... Very kool pool... Lovely food too,"Very lovely rooms with soft pillows. Located in heart of Victoria Island Lagos Nigeria... Great music, Clean environment. Nice cocktails, special tea, the grills are just perfect. Not to forget the manor bar, very beautiful",April 2018,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Apr 2018,,['19 contributions'],50,[]
Just a Basic Place to stay,"The location is good and in a quiet corner. The hotel is a bit dated - with rugged passage way! Inside is not bright, a bit dim even at night. I think most of the reviews are way off the mark by more than 30%. But still would recommend the place to any one who just want to spend a few days on the Island. Its very accessible.",December 2017,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Jan 2018,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria","['48 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30']"
Wonderful Experience,"I usually stay here at least twice a year whenever I go to Nigeria. The staff are very friendly, and constantly helping. The bed is so comfortable, I never want to get up. Although, it appears to be a bit dated, it is what gives it the appeal. I do prefer the opportunity of seeing the same staff members everyday, it gives it a personal feel since you don't see random people everyday. The food is actually really good, I highly record the Fisherman Stew: one word D-I-V-I-N-E!!!! People that do not even stay at the hotel order their food from the restaurant. The location is also very ideal, being in Victoria Island, it is easy to navigate the area.",February 2015,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Mar 2015,"Waco, Texas",['1 contribution'],50,"['Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Decent place to stay,"I used to stay in this hotel over 5 years, mostly for 2-3 weeks. It is a small a bit outdated boutique hotel with friendly staff, swimming pool, bar, gym, a good meal and quiet location. I wouldn't say it was the  best place but just enough to stay while on business trip. But there are some other better hotels in  Lagos though.    But non't expect everything to be excellent if you consider to stay in any of Nigerian hotels because there is no constant water/power supply in this country and sometimes you will hear a generator running in the back yard or no internet for a couple of hours.    Probably would stay again if nothing better is available.",February 2013,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jan 2014,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","['38 contributions', '16 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_30', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
"Well Located, Comfortble and Quiet","The hotel is tucked away behind Zenith row in VI, a very quiet and safe area of the city. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Rooms are comfortable, although decor is dated. Wifi is reliable but power less so - the latter being more fault of nepa (electricity provider) rather than the hotel. However, hotel's back-up generators usually kick in fairly quickly once the grid goes down. Food varies from pretty good to average depending what you order (Nigerian dishes/ seafood, especially prawn dishes very good - steak less so). All very reasonably priced. TV has all one needs - multiple Supersport channels and CNN! Pool is small and highly chlorinated. Gym is rubbish but useable (running machine, bike, multigym).   Tip for a good nights sleep! Turn off UPS (uninteruptable power",November 2013,Traveled on business,All rooms should be quiet.

Sweet hotel!,"I stayed at this hotel a lot. Once I stayed there for a month. I can say for sure you can feel there like at home. Small, private hotel with small swimming pool & gym, perfect location (Victoria Island), nice staff, big well-furnished rooms, cute restaurant.   The most I like the tthing if you nedd to go upstairs to your room, you have to slide your room card, without it the door which leads to the stairs won't open. So I was sure that if somebody was knocking my door, it was someone I was expecting.  You can park your car at the secured territory. They do have some extra parking places.   It's hotel is more suitable for business trips. It will be boring for staying there with kids for sure, limited space and no kids room.",February 2012,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jan 2013,"Washington DC, District of Columbia","['30 contributions', '16 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
"Good, but, never again","The company I work for booked me a stay in Palmview Manor, so I had no choice which hotel to book. The hotel is on Victoria Island extension, Lagos, in a very good location - close to the uptown hotels and restaurants. The staff were friendly and with big genuine smiles on their faces all the time. Clean rooms, comfy bed, and delicious food. Internet was very slow, so for someone who is on a business trip, this would be horrible. First night, there was no hot water in the toilet, and the 3rd day morning, there was no water at all. They sent me 2 water buckets; one with cold water and one with hot water... The shower water taps need serious plumbing. I don't mind staying here when on a vacation-pleasure, but if you're planning to stay here for a business trip, I don't recommend",March 2012,Traveled on business,Check the AC and plumbing in the toilet once you arrive.,wrote a review Mar 2012,"Aqaba, Jordan","['111 contributions', '65 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Rooms bubble_30', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Excellent experience,"My stay at The Palmview Manor hotel was a wonderful experience. They have very good rooms, speed delivery of service both in the room and restaurant. I had the opportunity of witnessing their newly introduced programme called 'Thank God Its Friday', it was beautiful. They have good water supply and the hot water was coming out very fast. My whole experience was a wonderful one and I felt like home away from home. Thank you for making my stay a wonderful stay.",September 2010,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Oct 2010,Lagos,"['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_50', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
Money well spent,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The bed was soooo comfortable, i did not even want to get up. I like the uniforms, and oh were the staff very friendly. The breakfast was so good, and they had all these flavored milk/cream for coffee. Earlier, i read some reviews about the hot water, but believe me the water was very hotttt, and i did not have to wait at all, the problem has been solved. They have a TGIF party every fridays, was chanced to attend with my friends. There was very good music and the grilled food was great.  let's just say that, i look forward to going back there.",October 2010,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Oct 2010,austell,['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"

A Coozy and friendly hideout,"The staff were very friendly and courteous. from the front desk to the restaurant there was aboundance of smiles. The room I stayed in was well cleaned and the bed  was so comfortable you could be late for an appointment. This particular room did not have a balcony though I later found out that the rooms with balcony were all occupied. I love the quiet atmosphere for resting but for a fun catcher you may get bore. I was told before I checked out that an event known as THANK GOD IT""S FRIDAY will be taking place every Friday from september. There will be music, assorted BBQs,food and drinks at discounted prices. An opportunity to unwind and socialize.  I look forward to this on my next visit.",August 2010,,,wrote a review Sep 2010,Abuja,"['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]
Friendly Hotel,"I stopped here in September after previously staying at the VCP hotel in Lagos. This place has a lot more character than the VCP. It may not be as new as some other places but it feels quiet and the staff were absolutely brilliant.  The food was good, including breakfasts and I'm looking forward to going back soon. The only negative was the hot water in the shower, mentioned in a previous review. I did have to turn the shower on and then go back later when the water had warmed up, but in fairness I was warned about it when I checked in.",September 2009,,,wrote a review Nov 2009,Stavanger,['1 contribution'],40,[]
A bit lost on the theme but excellent breakfast,"Stayed at this hotel overnight as we were going partying on the ""island"". Great location and very safe and secure.  Check-in was a nightmare as the card machines were not working, so had to go back to the highway to get cash.  First room was dirty and smelt of stale cigars, but the staff happily changed the room The theme is obviously Colonial Lagos - Why???  and what ridiculous outfits the staff had to wear. Felt so unfair, a modern twist on the colonial outfit would have been far kinder.  Amazing photos of old Lagos adorn the walls but shock as you enter the rooms - not a single hint of colonialism. lol Really comfortable bed and nice large room. Shower took forever to get hot, but otherwise really nice. Very quite and private location too.  The best part was breakfast, really",June 2008,,,wrote a review Jun 2008,"Calabar, Nigeria","['34 contributions', '34 helpful votes']",20,[]
Better than anticipated,"Lagos is never going to be a favourite destination but if you have business on Victoria Island you could do worse than this small place (20 rooms), described in their literature as a superior boutique hotel.  I hadn’t stayed in any of the Lagos hotels before (only a company guesthouse) but found myself here for 4 nights.  I thought the “standard” rooms rather small and dark but a “superior” one was a better proposition when I found I’d be there over a weekend.  The amenities in the room were better than I expected and having an iron and board in the wardrobe was very handy.  The food wasn’t bad (with greater choice than I anticipated) and could be served in the restaurant or in the small bar by reception (or in the rooms).  There is a relatively small swimming pool and gym",,,,wrote a review Jan 2007,England,"['279 contributions', '327 helpful votes']",40,[]
