The best Oasis of Calm in a Chaotic Lagos.,"Well The George, you certainly lived up to the great reviews that others have been giving you.   It was a very pleasant experience for me staying with you, with all the staff extreme courteous and very helpful.  The facilities were top notch and the food and drinks were very good.  What I loved most was the fact it was a quiet boutique hotel which was an oasis from the hustle and bustle of my short and busy trip.   Well done.  Please keep up the good service and congratulations to the management team who help run such a great hotel.",November 2023,Traveled solo,Just enjoy,wrote a review Nov 7,"Trowbridge, United Kingdom","['1 contribution', '3 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
The Hidden Gem of Ikoyi.,The Hidden Gem of Ikoyi.🇳🇬  I stayed at The George for 8 nights and from checking-in the service was seamless and professional.  The front desk staff immediately responds and resolves all issues and concerns.  The rooms are spacious and well designed and the bedding will give you the perfect Night Sleep and Nap.  A beautiful hotel boutique hotel with an exceptional restaurant which is underrated.  You must try the Fish Stew and the Okra Seafood.  The breakfast as well with a variety of options.  Sunday Brunch is a must with live music. The pool is esthetically pleasing but unused. I used the gym often which is well equipped.  I gave a 4 because there were quickly resolved noise issues with some of the guests.,August 2023,Traveled solo,There will be some sporadic power surges but no total blackouts.

GOOD...,"Visited with family and stayed a few nights. The location is good in highbrow Ikoyi area, though the opposite property is currently undergoing construction. This is a luxury hotel but comes quite expensive compared to others in the neighbourhood. The rooms are spacious and quite comfortable, richly furnished ditto the bathrooms with high speed showers.  However, the meals were not fantastic despite their huge cost. Buffet breakfast could do with more offerings. The George is a good place to splurge though.",May 2022,,2nd floor and above  are quieter,wrote a review May 2022,"Lagos, Nigeria","['1348 contributions', '56 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"

A wonderful weekend experience!,It was my first time staying here and I must say I really enjoyed it. The staff was super nice and very helpful  - my flight was severely delayed and everyone was so accommodating. I had a suite and it was nicely laid out with all the amenities I could want plus good coffee (Nespresso) since I am not a big instant fan. They also had masks and alcohol sprays.  The food was also pretty good. I usually go out to restaurants but I found that restaurant at the George was really good so I ate there quite a bit.

First time Lagos,We flew in Lagos for the first time for a business trip from Dubai - we were originally supposed to stay only one night in George hotel -   The welcoming atmosphere and the practical  location made us increase the duration for 4 additional nights -  Friendly team - great set up and cosy atmosphère !

A Fantastic St Valentines Stay!,In short OUTSTANDING - The George is one of Lagos' true high end hotels.  This visit was a St Valentines Day break for my wife and I. At every turn the hotel exceeded my expectations - from a call in the morning (before my arrival) to offer complementary room decorations; resulting in petals and chocolates - a true 'welcome' to the room. Poolside margaritas served by James in the afternoon was just the tonic we needed; before the St Valentines buffet dinner - complete with complimentary bubbly. A wonderful stay - great staff - great place.,February 2022,,,wrote a review Feb 2022,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]

"Stunning Comfortable Exquisite Hotel Ikoyi, Lagos","I had the honor and joy of recently staying at The George Hotel in Ikoyi, Lagos as I was preaching several days at a local church. I can’t say enough about the professionalism, kindness, and stunning nature of this hotel. Beyond any hotel I’ve ever stayed in. As a missionary I rarely stay in any hotel near this quality. The restaurant and service are equally outstanding. I would assign this hotel as high as possible!

Oh King George,"The George Hotel is definitely top of my favourite hotels in Lagos, the hotel feels very secure and the rooms are spacious. Though it is in a closed-off environment, the ambience around the hotel creates its own little community and a very good late evening vibe.

"Impressed with the George Hotel employee, Tope - made the visit perfect",This is my third visit to The George this year. I would stay nowhere else in Lagos. The safe atmosphere takes you out of the Lagos hustle bustle. The hotel manager is always around getting involved to ensure everything is perfect. The people are friendly and you feel the privacy.  I had a server out by the pool each time I came. Her name is Tope. She made sure to keep an eye on me to see if I ever signaled like I needed a drink or had a question. She would appear magically out of thin air! People like this make The George a special place.

Best hotel in Lagos,"For me this is the best hotel in Lagos, I’m usually here for at least 20-40 nights in a year, breakfast is good, Internet wasn’t for while but they improved it. It’s in a great location in ikoyi, close to the business district of Victoria island and also close the bridge that takes you the mainland.  It’s expensive but for the quality they give in Lagos it’s value for money, also they don’t have any loyalty program and that’s not so good for regulars like me.

Horrible pickup experience,"We waited nearly 2 hours for airport pickup. I was told that it was not arranged however I placed a request with my booking and received an email stating the special request was confirmed. The hotel sent a driver in an unmarked car. Not a hotel shuttle which was assumed. Upon arrival, the driver refused to speak to me. He spoke to my husband but refused to speak to me when I asked him a question directly. Apparently he does not respect women even when they are the person requesting the driver. It is the hotels responsibility to hire employees who respect all visitors.

"Had overbooked, so 5 of us were told to go to another hotel; also dealt very poorly","There were a group of 5 of us who were booked to stay at the George. We arrived in the evening and were told that the hotel was overbooked, so we needed to move to another hotel.   The situation was also dealt with extremely poorly and they made no efforts to make amends (no apologies and no offer of say dinner etc). Moreover, they lied about the room availability.    One lady from our group insisted that there must be one room available. She was told that it was a ""bad room"" she would not like. She insisted to see it and turned out to be a penthouse suite which they clearly did not want to give out.    We asked for the General Manager, who was apparently in the hotel, but busy.

Best hotel I’ve found in Lagos,"I’m a bit reluctant to write this In case the price goes up further or it gets booked out, but so far this is the best hotel in Lagos (I’ve not stayed at the Wheatbaker). Why? Because everything works, the rooms don’t smell of damp like in other hotels, shower works, WiFi is good, food is good, bar staff are friendly, check out is not time C.J. dining and they take Amex.

Best 5 Star Hotel in Ikoyi Lagos,"Excellent hotel with great decor and professional staff.  I kind of preferred my last stay at the George sometime last year as I noticed that there’s a reduction of staff at the moment which affected their services especially responses to requests which are now slower compared to last year. I’m guessing this is as a result of the economic downturn in the country. Other than that I found my accommodation comfortable and clean.

Impeccable service,"This is probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed. Yes, it is expensive, but totally worth it. First, I got upgraded to a penthouse suite, which is spectacular. it has a huge terrace with view to the pool, a very ample bedroom, a kitchenette and a huge living room.   But the most impressive is not the facilities, but the service. All the staff is so kind and wants to help you and please you. Everyone has always a smile in their face.  Food at the restaurant is stupidly good! I recommend you to try one of their pastas or the chili prawns. In addition, they include breakfast buffet, which has a lot of variety of Nigerian and Continental food with great quality and flavor.  Lastly, I came in my birthday, by coincidence, and they left me an awesome cake and bottle of wine in",July 2018,,,wrote a review Jul 2018,"Santa Clara, California","['543 contributions', '138 helpful votes']",50,[]
Average,"Boutique hotel on a fair amount of grounds. Well built with excellent paintings within, which give it a somewhat museum look.  Was however there for a 3 day meeting and didn’t lodge at the hotel but the conference room facilities were very good and we were well catered for.  There is a nice sit out by the pool where meals and drinks can be had. However be mindful of the humid weather in Lagos at certain times of the year.  The buffet appeared lean with not much of a choice and so I went for the a la Carte menu on each day for lunch. The Nigerian and contemporary dishes I had were actually quite good and in my view cooked to near perfection. Drinks and food are however very expensive so be mindful of how you order.

The events team were communicative, helpful and efficient in helping us set up the event, and it went smoothly from start to finish.

Last week in Lagos,"We arrived in Lagos, Nigeria 18 months ago and The George was home for 3 months while we were looking for permanent res. We leaving and spending our last week here again. It was great then and  nothing has changed. In the heart of VI. From entering the security gates to the check in there are smiles all over.The staff are most welcoming .  The hotel is elegant and in my opinion only the Wheatbaker Hotel , Lagos is very slightly ahead due to it having a Health Spa. The George is a business Hotel but our 14 year old was made to feel at home. The rooms are clean and spacious with all the amenities one requires . HD tv, safe, coffee machine, fridge etc Nothing lacking, perhaps more snacks in the mini bar. Has a great bar area ideal for informal meetings. Fully equipped gym .

Overpriced. Top-notch facilities (for Lagos) but sketchy policies,"First the good: Great location, brilliant facilities, everything works, great beds, sheets, bathrooms and (mostly) very pleasant and attentive staff. Free cold water in the gym, pool is spotless, 24 hour room service = so many things just right.  The not-so-good: 1) Early checkin: This is charged at 50% of the daily rate. With a room rate (for the cheap rooms) of $300 it stings to be asked to pay $150 for a chance to change and shower when you have the misfortune of arriving in Lagos at dawn. We were accommodated and given a room at 11.30 but the fact that we were even offered the paid-for early check-in demonstrates that there was a room available.

Everyday Sexism,"I stayed at the George for 5 nights with my husband. We sat down for some food by the pool one afternoon and I was handed a menu which had no prices against the food. Initially I was confused, until I checked my husbands menu to find his did have prices. I have never felt more insulted. For a hotel in 2018 to make it policy to treat all female customers this way is outrageous, outdated and sexist. For the hotel to make the assumption that my husband always pays for me is confusing at best and idiotic at worst.

Rooms are contemporary, clean, tasteful. Great free wifi throughout the hotel. A very inviting pool, and a well equipped gym. Bar is popular without being crowded. The restaurant is good, but could do with a somewhat more exciting selection of dishes and a more thoughtful wine list. Staff throughout is professional, enthusiastic, diligent, respectful. Christine at reception and Scholar in the restaurant are class acts.

"Still finding its feet, Poor Value","Just checked in yesterday and regretting my choice already.   I got here at 8AM, way before check-in, so I arrived expecting a wait. I didn’t, however, expect it to be the coldest wait ever. The air-conditioning in the lounge was way too strong and it felt even colder thanks to the rain. I asked the waiter to kindly turn it down a bit but he declined. I was particularly surprised since I was the only one there.  When I asked for my mocha to be served with soy milk (I’m lactose intolerant) I was told they didn’t have any. When I cancelled the order, the waiter insisted that regular milk would be fine and even asked me “What’s so special about soy milk?”   Getting some peace and quiet today for sleep has also been difficult.

By George - what a gem you are!,"For those who find themselves on the road whether for business or pleasure, the choice for accomodation can make a big difference to one’s perception of whether the trip was a wonderful and great trip or not. Having stayed at the intermittently disorganized Intercontinental Lagos a few times before moving to the wonderful Wheatbaker I was looking forward to this latest business trip.  My Lagos office threw me a curve ball and booked me to stay this time at The George. I didn’t check out the George on Tripadvisor and secretly hoped that the George is closer to the Wheatbaker experience I had previously.

The George is well staffed, well run, clean, cool and quiet, and lies within its own walls and security staff. Guest services are fully up to what one expects in a western hotel, fast service, good business center, attentive staff. The restaurant is simply excellent, with a mix of western standards and some excellent Nigerian dishes on buffet nightly. Room service is fast and efficient. Detractors? The wifi internet is somewhat spotty, and needs reinitializing almost hourly, but is strong, fast and capable otherwise (netflix streaming works well, for example). The pool is beautiful, but seems to have the slightest suspicious algae green cast.

Beware the Decaf Capuccino....,"I have read reviews about the slow service at the poolside, and my hubby and I experienced this when we went for   snacks and drinks by the pool on a Saturday evening. After several attempts to get a waiter's attention, we were finally attended to. They were polite and apologetic all right, but it was the same thing when trying to catch someone's attention to bring our bill and order a coffee.   I should have taken a cue from the waiter's momentary hesitation when I asked if they had decaf cappuccino. After taking one sip, I could tell it was instant coffee with a milky froth on top. When asked, the waiter did not deny it, he said it was decaf instant , but that he had put it through the espresso machine! Four bucks for instant coffee with a froth!  The food we ordered was tasty",January 2016,,,wrote a review Jan 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['81 contributions', '72 helpful votes']",30,[]

"Chef Anthony Robin, at the George in Ikoyi, Lagos","Outstanding Chef, pure and simple. He was kin=d enough to make a dish for my business partner and me, off the menu, especially for us. We were served a simple yet gorgeously cooked dish of pached salmon with pureed beetroot, sun blushed tomatoes, baby carrots and fresh, tender asparagus on creamy mashed potatoes. Reaaallllyyyy yummy!   The mark of a great chef is being able to make ingredients you normally hate (beetroot!) taste amazing. He achieved that for me. Furthermore, I’m usually not able to eat a whole dish in one go, but wiped my plate clean as I couldn’t bear to leave a single morsel on the plate. I paid the price the next day, though for my greed!
