Hell on Earth!!,"We stayed TWICE 2015-2016 for at total of 70 days. This place is TRASH. The owner and her son are a JOKE. I guess it was nice back in the day but not now. They BLACK LISTED my phone from  the WIFI after I complained about  the RAT in my room! Had to take a bath in a bucket! Can you say DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY,!! The Owner's son who is the GM gets drunk and has crying and shouting spells in the middle the night! Don't know why we went back a second time. I thought the devil you knew was better than the devil you don't know. But in this case I was wrong. This was a horrible experience ! No I would never recommend  this place.

"Quiet, secure, quaint","The African Garden Lodge is in a secure, quiet neighborhood within Ikeja, situated halfway between the airport and the island. The property is small, with only a few rooms. It has a homey feel, filled with artwork. The garden bar is a nice place to sit, and to meet. On the downside, as with many places in Nigeria, the service is less-than-responsive, the rooms aren't particularly clean, and there are issues with construction such as semi-functional showers. The laundry service lost (temporarily) half my laundry, but it was finally recovered.

From the outside it looks a little worn but once inside you are transported to an African themed oasis. Lovely rooms and great service. The bar area is a nice retreat. The room service is a bit slow and sometimes they got the orders wrong, but the friendly service makes up for it. A few losses of power but overall we had power 24/7.

Lovely hotel in the heart of Lagos mainland,"I stayed at this hotel for a few nights after arriving in Lagos. It is distinctly hidden away in Omole phase one. The location is central so you can get to anywhere in Lagos pretty much within an hour (if travelling at off-peak times) so very good for local attractions like the fela shrine and so on.  Staff were courteous, friendly and assisted me with my luggage upon arrival. The room was clean, spacious, and the bedding was comfortable. It had all the basic amenities that any guest would need. Theres an outdoor bar/lounge area which is to relax in, there's also a catfish pond. For anyone who loves African art and sculpture this hotel is for you....

Beautifully themed African themed dreamland; Surpassed expectations,"THE BASICS: This is lodge has a resort feel. I stayed in the standard room which was great. It has American must-haves such as power generator, hot shower from the tap (doesn't require turning on a point of use water heater and waiting), fan (this is to keep the air circulating), and air conditioner. The shower is located in a traditional, separate bathroom with sink and toilet.  Now for the ambiance..... I loved this place. It is located in what one may view as a gated community so security was top notch. Once inside the lodge, the beauty of bamboo, large clay pots, palm trees, greenery, and African traditional masks await.  It is truly a beautiful place. There is both an onsite restaurant and bar.

"Good people, competitive pricing for the city","Finding a hotel (or hostel, had there been one) in Lagos that I could afford was challenging but I'm so glad I booked here. Airport pickup was reasonably priced (although if you've not been to Lagos before, be warned that it can be hard to find people!) and, like most things in Lagos, rates were negotiable. My bed had clearly suffered from some damp but the room was clean and everything worked. The hotel bar and restaurant was beautiful and everyone working there was friendly and chatty (which was welcome to a solo female traveller!). Ikeja is also the area of Lagos where Fela Kuti's The Shrine was located (and where Femi Kuti's New Afrika Shrine still is), which was unplanned - well worth going to hang out and have a drink!

Excellent service but.......,"Visited my favourite Lagos lodging after about 13 months and had to write a review. On arrival, I still got the sense of being in a secure home, the staff were welcoming and very efficient. One of the best features of the lodge is the feeling of being a welcome guest in a home.  Paid N11,000 (I think) for my Queen room and my luggage were carried in.   The room is in desperate need of maintenance, the ceiling was stained and falling off and the whole room, although clean, was very tired and begging for refurbishment. The shower room is small and the wardrobe is in the shower room which isn't clever. The water pressure is not strong but there is hot water on demand.

Feels like home,"I stayed several days and in several rooms at African Garden Lodge in July and August 2012. The theme of African art is expressed every where in the hotel, from the walkways, to the lobby and the rooms. If you are a lover of art you will find this place interesting. My favorite thing about it is the location and atmosphere - you wouldn't know it is a hotel, except in the evenings when the bars are active. It also has good security and courteous staff. I asked for the manager to see me and he came happily! In a country with dysfunctional public power supply this hotel runs its power generators most of the time, yet the pricing is affordable - starts from about 60 USD for standard room (air-conditioner, fan, hot water, cable, but no refrigerator, bigger rooms have more features",July 2012,,,wrote a review Sep 2012,"Lagos, Nigeria","['2 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
All Staff Are Like Extended Family.,"First of all, big thanks to all the STAFF of this beautiful, quite and peaceful hotel. Names like Emma, Emeka, Igwe, Endurance, Uche, Sylvester and countless names. Me, and my family (Wife and  3 little ones, ages 6, 4,and 2) stayed at this hotel for 3 full weeks. With such a hassle life of Lagos, at the end of the day, we always come home (the hotel) to peace and tranquillity. I've been to many hotels, but never seen helpful staff like AGL. They are always there to lend a hand in one way or the other. From directing us to where ever we need to go, to helping us getting things we may need.

Great value for money in an ideal location,"My wife and I stayed for 7 nights whilst doing some sight seeing, visiting family and a little business. It's location is more central than the major hotels on Victoria Island which enabled us to to get to most parts of Lagos within an hour or so. Situated in a safe, walled houing estate,it's a small hotel with 3 bars. The 2 outside bars are open to the public - mainly residents of the estate and have the usuall TV screens, music etc. The smaller garden bar at the back of the hotel seems to be for residents and is much quieter so plenty of choice. The hotel arranged for us to be picked up at the  airport which went very smoothly.

A Safe Haven,"My mother and I spent 10 nights at the African Garden Lodge towards the end of July.  We were in the African Garden Queen room, opposite the bar.  The room was modest in size, clean and well furnished.  The bathroom was a little on the small side and lacked storage space for toiletries, but the large-headed shower worked a treat.  Hangers were scarce but these were soon provided.  Overall the room was pleasant and cool (great air con) but could have done with a fresh lick of paint. Fresh towels and bedding are provided daily - if requested, otherwise the room is untouched.

A rare island of tranquillity and taste in the chaos of Lagos.,"If you need to stay in the Ikeja area of Lagos this a fantastic place to stay.   The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and decorated tastefully (my favourite room is the African Royal Suite), the food is good and best of all you don't feel like you are staying in an institution. African Garden Lodge is definitely not as fancy as the big business hotels in Lagos - be prepared for the occasional hiccup with running water supply - but it beats them hands down for value for money, atmosphere and service.

Forget the faceless international places this is what you really want,"I spent 3.5 weeks there and Mama still rules although she has retired. The hotel is clean and most things work most of the time. Staff are really good and nothing is too much trouble. When I asked where I could go to smoke a Shisa pipe, they went and bought one so that I could smoke it in the hotel bar. Food is really good, with a range of traditional African and European dishes. The fresh catfish is really good and if you dont want the hot pepper you can order it without. They have wonderful BBQ chicken. My request to have pounded yam with bolognaise sauce instead of pepper soup was met with surprise but it arrived as requested.

"This place is a must stay! If you travel to Lagos, there is no other place to go.","In terms of service, I absolutely fell in love with the African Garden Lodge. I traveled with my brother. From the pickup at the airport to our departure (around five days), this was the best customer service during my entire two week stay in Africa (also stayed in Ghana.) Mama and the management staff helped arrange transportation/guides for our stay. They were helpful in recommendations on activities on which to do, and frankly made us feel like we were at home every moment of the trip.

Great Place,"So this is a long-delayed review, for I stayed at the AGL back in August 2009. But I have been meaning to write and the time is now. I slept at the AGL on two separate occasions. The first time I had a quite small, unimpressive room on the backside of the property called the Garden Standard Room. The room itself wasn't great but the food was good, the ambience was great, and I liked being in the neighborhood, away from the street chaos. (Plus, it allowed me to exercise in the neighborhood without problems.) The second time I went back, a couple weeks later, I got The African Queen, I think it was called, and I really can't recall a better value anywhere. Great, clean room. TV.

Better than expected,"We were a groupof 6 including grandmother,parents and 3 older children one of whom is a teen. We stayed in the African royalsuite and the African Queens Suite both of which surpassed our expectations forone night. They were both large and comfortable and provided enough space for all six of us.The bath and toilet facilities were good.We were collected from the airport by the hotel shuttleservice -large airconditioned cars ,my only gripe was the music being played in the car. Eminem with all his swearing is not my first second orl ast choice.The driver did oblige and change the music when asked.

Peaceful African Garden Hotel,Spent 1 night at African Garden Lodge but looking forward to returning for a weekend. The hotel isolates you from the chaotic city life of Lagos and really makes you feel at peace. If you are a leisure visitor looking for a getaway in the middle of Lagos or on a business trip but can schedule yourself to avoid the hold-up to Ikeja area of Lagos where this hotel is located then I highly recommend. The only thing of discomfort is the odour that sometime emanates of stagnant water around the outdoor areas possibly due to clustered vegetation or drainage. The hotel is very affordable with rooms ranging from $50 - $120 a night. I stayed in a standard room ($60) which was adequate with a tiny but clean toilet.

Service with a smile (and lots of useful Naija tips),"I think it is fair to say that I approached my first trip to Lagos (and Nigeria) with trepidation.  I was a female travelling solo with no friends or contacts in Lagos, a city I needed to transit through (to visit a friend in Kano).  Enter African Garden Lodgeâ€¦  I found them on Trip Advisor as a better alternative to the Sheraton, relatively close to the airport, offering a pick up drop off service, and most importantly with reassuringly wonderful reviews!  Sam and Mike were waiting for me when I arrived and my anxiety about being in Lagos vanished by the time I jumped into the hotelâ€™s new air conditioned vehicle.

It is not a bad place to be, but not a hidden gem, I thought it was. The Mama's bar gathers some interesting international Nigerians if you like to build your contact network. Sports is widely shown on hotel's TV channels and at the bar which is good, if you are a sports fanatic like I am.

Good and bad.,"I was very excited about my planned stay at the African Garden Lodge (AGL), as I had read other reviews and also found hotels listed online to be generally very expensive in Lagos.

"A small Hotel with nice Gardens, Art, Charm and Character","I stayed here for 3 nights in December and in terms of value for money, the African Garden Lodge does rate reasonably in my opinion, for a Lagos Hotel. It is clearly not designed to be like a Southern Sun or Federal Palace, but more as a small boutique hotel with a  signature of Art, Gardens and character. It meets this criteria well and I enjoyed my stay here. Note though, the rooms are small (although with double beds) but perfectly acceptable if you just want  somewhere clean, air conditioned and safe to sleep over.

The  African Royal Suite is extemely spacious with a large king size bed, two cable TV's (one in a separate lounge), full batroom and airconditioning. The Hotel has a back up generator so power is not a problem. We dined at the al fresco restaurant and the food was varied & delicious. Thanks Mama we had a GR8 time and will be back.

"Cosy, quiet and good value for money!","Tucked away inside Ikeja, is this unique hotel. Not the largest but cosy, nice and quiet, exotic setting that will go down well for those wanting the African look. The good experiences started with the airport pick up. The gentleman Sam, one of the staff took it upon himself to ensure we felt comfortable.  We had to call on the use of their vehicle very often for going out and being picked up through our 3 day staff and they were very prompt with a very polite driver.   The furniture was nice and comfortable from the bed to the chairs as hinted at by our children. You walked along a path with luscious evergreen leaves to the restaurant and bar and enjoyed a good meal. They prefer being informed in advance before your coming down to eat.   There is a free internet access",July 2009,,,wrote a review Aug 2009,"Leiden, The Netherlands","['262 contributions', '50 helpful votes']",40,[]

Underpriced with much quality!,"My husband and I stayed at the African Garden Lodge in March for two weeks. I must confess this is one nice hotel for the price. While other hotels were ranging from $180-$300. We found this hotel with rates under $80. I pray that they keep up with the maintenance of this hotel because I will surely stay here again.  The hotel is gated and has 24 hour security. The security staff were very courteous. The front desk staff were great. Sam and Kola were very helpful. Sam was always kind and available to assist whenever we needed anything. Kola was very friendly with a smile that could brighten anybody's day. When I first walked into my room, I said ""wow this is really nice!!"" The resturant served good food. It's expensive, but tastes good. My favorite was the battered fish and",March 2009,,,wrote a review May 2009,US,"['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
A great hideaway. Simply fabulous,"I just returned from a trip to Lagos and stayed at the African Garden Logde for about a week in May.  By the time I was leaving, I felt like I was leaving my home. This place is a true oasis, private, secure, very serene and truly African.  Great food, Great people. Great rates.  The staff were friendly, helpful and courteous.  The rooms were clean with nice african decor and beautiful gardens/surroundings. I hope to return soon and will definitely be staying at Mama's place.",May 2009,,,wrote a review May 2009,Enfield,"['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
A Home from home in the midst of the chaos that is Lagos,"To be honest, I was reluctant to share this little secret, for fear that if it becomes too popular I wouldn't get a room next time I'm in Lagos, but it deserves better from me after the great time I had there. At the end of a sweltering day in the heat and insane traffic that is the Lagos ""go-slow"", where do you most want to be? Let me save you the guesswork: Mama's Place, The African Garden.  A great shower (that works), a quick change (in a spotless, air-conditioned room) and then an icy cold Gulda or two with some not-too-heavy-but-delicious peppered prawns in the Garden Bar (Not on the menu? No probs. Just talk to Mama. Nothing's ever too much trouble).  If a hotel is a place to stay, this isn't a hotel. It's a place to be! A place to entertain!

A perfect piece of paradise!,"My husband, 13mth old daughter and I stayed at the African Garden Lodge from 28th March to 14th April. We decided to choose this hotel because of the positive reviews that it had here on Trip Advisor and I am glad to say that we weren't disappointed. We stayed in the African King which cost us aprox. N9000 (GBP36) per night. The room was very clean and spacious and didn't feel overcrowded even when we put up our daughter's travel cot. The bathroom was huge and we had hot water on demand as well as really great water pressure for the shower.There are some wonderful African paintings on the wall and the bed linen and blinds also picked up on the African theme. We also had some beautiful plants in the room. We benefited from cable tv our bedroom , so we were able to keep up with",April 2009,,,wrote a review Apr 2009,London,"['15 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",50,[]

A breath of fresh air,"My friend and I came to the the African Garden Lodge after a particularly unpleasant experience in another more expensive hotel in the locality. We were pleasantly suprised by the really nice ambience of the environment and how swithced-on and helpful the staff were.  What set the place apart in my esteem is the fact that it is not only family managed, but that the Owners are resident on site to keep an eye on things. My colleague and I thouroughly enjoyed our stay and I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone else.",February 2009,,,wrote a review Feb 2009,London,"['1 contribution', '3 helpful votes']",40,[]
"Amazing Oasis in Lagos, loved this great hideaway","Just got back from a trip to Lagos and found this fantastic little hotel. It is called African Garden Lodge in Omofade Crescent Omole Phase 1. Not far from the airport in a gated estate with top security.   The grounds are amazing with palm trees and African sculptures. The staff are polite and helpful and the rooms in the main house start at N8,000 a night. I stayed in the Suite for N13,500 and it is fantastic really!!!! Beautifully decorated with African Art, LCD tvs, Internet and 2 (yes, 2) toilets. The theme was so skillfully carried through the hotel, from the polite staff to the choice of bed linen.    The food is delicious and when I said ""no pepper"", there was none.  This is a real home from home and the owner can be seen tending the plants during the evening.
