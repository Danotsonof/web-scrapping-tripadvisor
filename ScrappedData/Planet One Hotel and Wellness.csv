Closing Down?,This review was written throughout my two night stay in the hotel on 3-5 February.  Possibly the strangest hotel experience of 20 years in Africa.  I checked in yesterday to find the air conditioner in my room wasn't working. The engineer came and said he had fixed it. 30 minutes later it clearly wasn't working so I went to reception. They said they would arrange a new room. Four rooms and about 2 hours later we had finally found a room where most things function (air conditioner/shower/tv. Nothing fancy!). So I settle in and just rest.  Today I went to meetings in the area. I get a call at 3pm asking me to come back to the hotel for an emergency. Apparently they had decided to immediately close for emergency refurbishment and we're moving me out!

WOW!,"What a place to be. I and my husband had the beautiful bar to ourselves. It's a top top for romance.  There's a champagne room where friends and couples could have a quiet great time, watch musical videos and eat good food. What an exotic design. The whole decor is elegant and exotic.

Very close to the airport,"I have stayed in here twice. The first time I was there, I was given a room I didnt like so well. the floor was pretty sandy and the bathroom also was not just ok. I didnt like the towel too... Didnt look all that neat to me.  The second time I was there, I got a good room with even a mini-Jacuzzi. I didnt know they had that stuff in that hotel.  I enjoyed the their meals. The food was good.  I enjoyed the gym and the instructor there was really friendly. They got very friendly staff also.

Cool place;nice staff!!,"I've stayed at Planet One three times in the last couple of months and always found the service pretty good and the staff cool and helpful  The hotel is in a great location for Ikeja and well timed runs to the island........it is nicely decorated and reflects the style of the owners who have put their individual stamp on the rooms and common areas ( the charcoal prints are amazing)  A few niggles on the always closed safe,flaky wifi in certain rooms and the idiosyncratic shower..........I thought the staff were very nice and always did their best......it's not easy running a hotel and venue in Nigeria......folk who are used to western standards should not harshly judge.....it's clean and neat and comfortable and sure beats those overpriced places like its neighbour the Sheraton",October 2014,Traveled on business,Front facing can get some late night music from time to time!,wrote a review Nov 2014,"Nottingham, United Kingdom","['9 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"

Hospitality Horror,"If you ever have the opportunity to stay over- or have a Conference in Lagos Maryland I would sincerely advise you not to make use of this Hotel for anything.  As a General Manager for a Tourism Company we've booked with them after their Sales team begged me to bring my business to them, but it all ended up in a horror situation where we had to arrange the venues ourselves and the Management were so rude with derogatory remarks and foul language that I have decided never to return again... I am so sorry that my innocent Nigerian colleagues had to see this as some of the Ladies were very upset with what happened.

Nightmare from Hell,"I would like to firstly say My company will never return again. We were asked to make use of there facilities, so we did,  however when we asked for things to get sorted out without being unreasonable.  The GM used foul language and refused to assist after we paid for services.  We then had to set up the hall on our own. I would advise not to use them at all as there is no client service where you feel bad to ask for anything even though you have paid.

Interesting,"well, where do i start. rooms are nice. there were a few issues though, jacuzzi not working, pool closed etc, but overall, it was a good stay. Girls at the desk was pleasant. When my partner and i returned from the trip Bisola who works at the front desk sent my husband a whatsapp message to ask how he was doing. she told him how much she would love to see him again and was asking when he would return to Lagos. Now, im not sure if all the girls at the desk are like this, but ladies watch out. She even started to send pictures of her self. i will attach it to so that everyone can see.  the housemen(cleaners) are really pleasant and well mannered and the bellmen are welcoming. overall (except for the surprise messages from Bisola trying to get too acquainted with my man)",May 2014,Traveled as a couple,choose an executive room,wrote a review Jun 2014,,"['5 contributions', '12 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"

Hmmmmmmmm,"I echo the previous poster's comment about having mixed feelings for the place. Planet one sooo gets it right in some places but then manages to get it awfully wrong in other departments. My partner and I found the rooms to be of a decent size with very fine fittings and air-conditioning but that was about it. The breakfast buffet is basic at most, we had the same issue with toast that wasn't toast and very bad coffee, it is worth ordering hot food direct from the menu whilst there is little in the sense of continental choices, we were pleasantly surprised with our lunch and dinner. The swimming pool was out of order throughout our stay and we were promised it would be fixed, it wasn't!.The changeover from NEPA to the generator's is quick but not particularly fluid, this got in",May 2014,,,wrote a review May 2014,"Los Angeles, California","['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",30,[]
Mixed feelings,"Once I realised that the location on my mapping programme, just after the police college, is wrong and I found the hotel on the other side of the road close to the Lagos-Ikorodu Express, I was greeted by a friendly Cross Riverian named Bassey, like the majority of people in Calabar, who actually comes from a compound in walking distance (5-10 minutes) from my office. The room was very spacious, so was the bathroom with walk-in shower and jacuzzi, and, best of all, the first bidet I saw in Nigeria! The room temperature was an unbearable and humid 28 degrees, it came down to 24 (still not acceptable) degrees by the following morning (14 hours?). Has anybody thought about turning on the AC prior to my arrival? Obviously NOT!

Quite Impressive,"Planet One impressed me because it doesn't try to be like the identikit Sheratons or Eko Hotels. The decor gave it the feel of a boutique hotel although the rooms and en suite bathrooms were massive. The bellboys are extremely good although I did have to carry my bag to the reception desk when I came in. Breakfast was nice, I ordered a fry up which was excellent although having to pay for water was bizarre given that juice was free. The location is perfect - it's not too far from the airport, it's ideal for the Lagos-Ibadan expressway and in terms of safety there's a police command and army Cantonment just up the road. Planet One unfortunately falls down on several aspects - firstly the bathrooms - the bath floors and jacuzzi tubs need to be sparkling clean if they wish to",March 2014,,,wrote a review Mar 2014,"London, United Kingdom",['1 contribution'],40,[]

Good Value in Maryland,"Stayed at Planet One for a night in Oct. 2013. The price was pretty decent compared to other hotels in the same area and I was curious about it after seeing it from the outside several times while in Lagos on business. Overall, I was pleased with the experience: the staff were warm and friendly, service in the restaurant was fairly good and, while the breakfast was limited in selection, it got extra points from me for having made-to-order omelets. The rooms were good as well, with plenty of space and modern decor. The building is a bit old, but it seems well kept and we were comfortable throughout.

The toiletries provided in the room are minimal. The tea bags, etc. are just good for one or if you are lucky two cups of tea. Only one bottle of 500ml. water (per day) is complimentary. Anything more is chargeable. They will not provide you drinking water in a jug too.The AC was good. The internet gave me a problem one evening. Worked well the other days.

"Good , but leaves much to be desired.","Was here for almost 2 weeks for my wedding, even in the executive rooms, plumbing for bathroom heater and refrigerator was very poor. sometimes the toilet wouldn't flush, we kept changing rooms due to flooding. i was amazed that throughout the 2 weeks of my stay non of the top managers found the time to even come apologize or give us a concession, when i used the gym we had to pay for water.   Another very embarrassing situation was how me and my wife kept getting embarrassed at breakfast, when one of the staff shows and says ""food is only free for one"" , then when i complained it was a double occupancy room they came back and apologised. only for the whole drama to play out again the next day. i had to personlly request the food manager, he grudgingly came and affirmed, but it",July 2013,,,wrote a review Aug 2013,"Richmond, Texas",['1 contribution'],30,[]

This hotel has come along way,Stayed only one night between stop over for travelling on.  I had stayed 3 years prior and the hotel was a mess and dirty.  They have made major upgrades and as far as hotels in Nigeria go I found Planet One to be very nice.  The staff was very courtiess and helpful.  The room was large (studio living area and bed) with a seperate bath that had a shower and jacuzzi tub.  The room was clean and the linens crisp.  I ate at the Bamboo Resturant (Chineese) and was moderate and I enjoyed the spicy nature of some of the dishes.  I hope that my next trip through Lagos will allow me to stay at this location again.

"beware of mere spiteful comments, still a nice experience @planet one!","i was supposed to have stayed in one of the nearby motels but eventually got to this planet one hotel.it is really a breathtakin place, with classy interior.but i guess if you want to be spiteful you can say foul things about the good experience others have had in this place.i did see a lot of renovation work going on, especially on the first floor and the warm and respectful service staff reassured me that all the work going on is just to make things better, which i did witness.there is a lift in the hotel, you really was never in this hotel if you failed to see the new beautiful lift they put up.i ended up staying 2 more nights than i had planned anyway...n i have absolutely no regrets whatsoever!",October 2012,,,wrote a review Oct 2012,"Richmond, Virginia","['3 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",30,[]

they said it was good to stay at planet one hotel...it is,"whenever she travels to nigeria my friend used to hang out at this planet one hotels bar bamboo, and with its all africa theme and ambience, i used to hear a lot from sally that it is a nice place to stay, recreate, and catch some african vibe fun.the world is full of such stories from hotels, especially when those lagos hotels that are not international brands used to have such low service quality in lagos but when i got to this planet one hotel place it was everything i have heard and more.nice location, just a couple of minutes from the international airport, good security, with army and police stations across the road in case of dire emergency, even though they still have good internal security on their own.the rooms are classy, n the food service is nice.you should try this",September 2012,,,wrote a review Sep 2012,"Sicili, Italy","['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]

the most pleasant place to stay in lagos nigeria!,"i forgot to write this review until a friend called me to ask me where he can find an exclusive hotel to stay in lagos nigeria. and i knew that i had to do this to help other people lookin too. this planet one place is too good to be true!they have the best rooms i have ever stayed in in west africa.i actually got there from ghana where i had my business workshop, and just decided to hop over to lagos see a couple of friends working with the state government in lagos. the security is tight and the planet one hotel is located just within 10 yards of the police station nearby. they also have ample facility security well trained and organised. the food is good, ask for the african trybes restaurant and enjoy the best cuisine africa has got to offer. the pool is indoors but it is",August 2012,,,wrote a review Sep 2012,"Melbourne, Australia","['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
"if you staying in Lagos, try Planet One hotel aimiede!","i came with a focus group to do some research work in lagos and i got to find this planet hotel.it is just 5 minutes from the airport, and at most 5 more if there is traffic. and it is really a wonderful place to stay if you are visiting for both business or pleasure. they have this breathtaking bar, africa themed and everything, like a jungle rennaissance joint or somthin. it is the greatest place to unwind in the whole of the hotels i have ever stayed in my life, with over thirty years of traveling.the new wings of the hotel have got nice interior, and the service if great. you would find great culinary experience in their african trybes kitchen, it was a big deal for me to find most of the african delicacies i am familiar with on their menu.they also have great continental",September 2012,,,wrote a review Sep 2012,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
a touch of class with excellent happy services = planet one hotel aimiede!,"m girlfriend dragged me to this hotel last month and it was like alice wandering into wonderland. the soft glow of the night lights in this cozy and exquisite luxury called planet one could never really expose the total happiness ambiance that this place provides. the rooms are clean, fresh and invigorating. i came to this place not knowing what to expect but i left with the conviction that some really still CARE about the values of real hospitality. the ACs were newly installed on my wing (if you get to this cozy happiness haven ask for the new wing rooms) and they have 50% discount around festive periods.i went during ramadan, and was told the same thing goes for easter and xmas! the guest relations manager is a smiling goddess who made sure we lacked for nothing. the new lift",August 2012,,,wrote a review Sep 2012,"accra, ghana","['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]
Poor service,"I stayed in this ""hotel"" last December and i experienced the poorest service I have ever got in an hotel. The AC didnt work in my room, the room was dirty and when i asked to move the another room it took them too many hours to do so. The other room was better but still far from being a glam. The food was very basic, no meat at all during all my stay, same dishes were served differently every time.

Appalling,"We travelled to Lagos to attend a wedding and were originally lodged at Protea in Ikeja where the service was courteous and professional, however as we were with the bridal party the standard rooms were too small for the bride and bridesmaids to change in. They were also admittedly quite expensive. We therefore moved to Planet One were, as it was a weekend we were given a 50% discount for what they called the Regency suites. We booked two and a bridal suite for 3 nights. My suite which I booked with my sister and which was supposed to be an upgrade on an executive suite did not have a single mirror in it and only one window which was within touching distance of a grey block, so no light there.  The bathroom had a Jacuzzi however the water was tepid so it wasn’t worth using.
