I was not wowed like I expected I'd be.,"The check-in took time. I wasn't very impressed with the room because I was greeted with damp smell and the rug in the room looked worn out. those tiny ants were all over my desert before morning. they need to fumigate. I expected more actually. But I did enjoyed my sleep and I loved the atmosphere at the hotel, the lagoon side was very beautiful. security was excellent and staff were very helpful and professional",December 2019,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Dec 2019,,['1 contribution'],30,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_30', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
Maintenance survey,"My review on this survey is to submit that Radisson Hotel stand a quality with good location for sight view and relaxation.

Horrible check-in experience,"It was a business trip. The check-in experience was horrendous. Despite making a long flight with booking, the front desk staff one hima made it quite unpleasant. When I referewd to the fa t that it was not the first time I was checking with the same conditions his co-front desk colleague was worse or very unhelpful. I am not sure they fully understand that check-in experience is a critical part if the service.",November 2019,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Dec 2019,,['1 contribution'],30,"['Value bubble_20', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_20', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"

EXCELLENT SERVICE,"I enjoyed myself and generally had a wonderful stay in Radisson Blu. I am looking forward to spending time there again with members of my family.

It was excellent,"The experience was a great one, liked the location close to the water, excellent dinning facilities and food, beautiful rooms but i think the rug should be eliminated cos they are getting old rather i recommend parquet floors and most importantly i think your rooms are over priced during weekdays. Consider price reduction to increase patronage and clientele base. All the same i enjoyed my stay at your hotel and looking forward to another stay if the prices are more competitive.",November 2019,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Nov 2019,,['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
