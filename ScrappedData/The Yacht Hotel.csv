A Couple's getaway,"Premium no doubt. The ocean view was everything. Romantic and relaxing. The Sailors lounge beside the facility was the icing on the cake. Really a very comfortable atmosphere with all the necessary trappings. Location was cool too. The environment was clean, quiet and compact.",September 2022,Traveled as a couple,Pricey. Expensive.

Excellent luxury hotel,"I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at this hotel. Right from the external entrance to the hotel, you get the sense that this is not your typical hotel in Lagos. The environment is exquisitely maintained and cleaned. Even more so for the interiors, corridors and rooms. You can tell that someone is paying close attention to details in all spheres.  The room rates definitely aren't cheap, but the location beside the lagoon adds to the allure of this hotel and meals by the water is an experience in itself. During my stay, they had to change our room to enable completion of emergency repairs and we go a free upgrade for our troubles. Though expected, it is still a nice touch to get this gesture from a hotel managed entirely by local staff.  Well done. I will surely be staying",December 2022,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Dec 2022,"Lagos, Nigeria","['4 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_40', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"

"Great Hotel, Fantastic Stay","My Stay at the Yacht hotel was very good. It's a very pretty hotel that's been decorated and designed to a high standard. The hospitality service was excellent, my room was very clean and very cosy, their wifi is very fast with no downtime. It's very easy to disconnect from the outside world when you're in it, and I would recommend staying here to anyone.  There were a couple of drawbacks though: The restaurant menu lists a number of options that aren't available or that the restaurant staff don't know is on the menu. Also, if you like sleeping on a firmer mattress their beds will be perfect but I personally prefer a medium to soft mattress.",November 2022,,"City view rooms are noisy at night cause of a lounge that's beside the hotel, seaview rooms...",wrote a review Nov 2022,,['1 contribution'],40,"['Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
FUN AND RELAXING,I really enjoyed my stay at the Yacht Hotel. The reception was fun. It has an exquisite view and the service is epic. I believe my colleagues and I will make it our home in Lagos.

Visit to this Hotel was excellent. Staff were polite and helpful.,The room was big and spacious. The bathroom and toilet was well laid out and nice. Ambience was good. I will definitely revisit when in town. All drinks in the fridge were on the house. The restaurant was located at the back of the hotel with a view of the ocean.,August 2021,,Good view of the ocean but depends on your room,wrote a review Sep 2021,,['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
