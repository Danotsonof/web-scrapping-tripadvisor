"Nice, quiet and artsy spot","Bogobiri is a nice place for those seeking a touch of culture , art and / or the African vibe. Good food (including local delicacies), nice cultural environment and the occasional live band make this a very nice chill out spot.",August 2020,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Aug 2020,"Lagos, Nigeria","['747 contributions', '117 helpful votes']",40,[]
Money stolen from room,"Generally, I enjoyed staying in this small hotel / guest house. Unfortunately, my experience was spoiled shortly before leaving when I discovered that a significant amount of money had been stolen from my room (there are no safes either at reception or in the room). The owner was helpful in assisting me report the incident to the police, but ultimately did not take responsibility for the theft, presumably by a staff member who had access to the room in my absence. Beware of Room 8, in which the toilet and shower are on a raised platform in the bedroom (i.e. not in a separate en suite room).",September 2019,Traveled on business,Avoid Room 8 - toilet/shower in same room as bed,wrote a review Oct 2019,,"['3 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",10,[]
"Fun atmosphere, good live music, potentially good restaurant","This is indeed a quirky spot combining bar, shop, boutique hotel and restaurant.  The bar has a fun laid back atmosphere and the band talented and friendly.   Perhaps a bit loud for any conversation but that could be my age. The small restaurant has an interesting menu but on our Friday night visit, the Nigerian kitchen had ""closed"" at 6pm (?) which was a shame as I hoped to try some local dishes.  Still, the food was decent and reasonably priced.

"Nice, but felt a little empty","Room was nice, but it felt a little dark. If I opened the curtains I was just looking at other buildings so that was no help. The art around was cool, but it wasn't displayed very nicely, giving the guest house a sort of store-room feel. I didn't try the bar/restaurant downstairs, but it looked cool. Again, though, it was a bit dark. I'm not sure if I would stay here again, but it seems like a good value for the money.",January 2019,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Mar 2019,"Penang, Malaysia","['42 contributions', '47 helpful votes']",30,"['Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
Lovely place,"I'd give this place six stars if I could. I stayed at Bogobiri my first couple of nights in Nigeria in early November. It's got live music; a comfortable, unique, artistic feel; and great food. But as importantly -- because I am a woman traveling alone in Nigeria for the first time -- the wonderful people at Bogobiri matter the most. Bogobiri sent a driver to pick me up personally at the airport, and I recommend the driver too (Rafiu). The staff made me feel at home and advised with transport, SIM card, changing money, etc. Within the first 24 hours I had fallen outside and hurt my leg. Someone from Bogobiri walked me to a clinic and then came back mid-way through my appointment to make sure everything was okay. Later, the owner (maybe?) made my day by chatting with me over",November 2018,Traveled solo,"If you want something, ask for it on email.

Your first trip to Nigeria? Stay at Bogobiri!,"The Bogobiri is not perfect. Sometimes the WiFi does not work the way it should, sometimes you have to wait too long for the food, sometimes it is very noisy. But I still love it!!!! The staff is great! They are extremely friendly and will help you with everything. The food is delicious and well prepared. Even as a European I never had a problem with my digestive system. The rooms are clean and very big. Nearby you will find a supermarket, ATM's of different banks and a Domino's Pizza as well as a Cold Stone Creamery (in case you get tired of the delicious Nigerian cuisine after some time).  And the Bogobiri House offers much more: There are many live music events with great singers! There is also an art gallery attached to the hotel.

"Culture, Regeneration, Leisure (and a little business)","We came to Bogobiri for the first time, and we stayed for several nights and days with our three kids. And we loved it!, although for one member of the family there was too much of art pieces allover, creating some nightmare at night. However, personelle is so friendly, food is alright, and you must expect always some surprises, some artistic or just social happenings. Yes, and otherwise, it is just a nice place to relax.

Bogobiri..,"I love the live band, the food was on point. Service wasn't as prompt but the waiter was a nice and patient guy.

Great performances!,"I went to Bogobiri with a co-worker while on a biz trip to Lagos. It lived up to my expectations for a lively and soulful and fun time, with some firecracker singers and guitarists.

Different!,"Not your flashy restaurant/ bar but everything about the look & feel is very artistic. The sculptures outside, the traditional-looking wooden chairs and tables, the art gallery upstairs, paintings of Wole Soyinka as you climb up the stairs to the gallery, and the piano. I couldn't resist tinkling the ivories. Most of all I loved the veteran band - some really good reggae music.   The fish pepper soup was a bit too spicy for me though; although it tasted good I was very disappointed they couldn't make it milder although we gave specific instructions the second we ordered.

Delightful stay at Bogobiri House,"This artfully designed, delightfully entertaining, well staffed boutique hotel was a comfortable and relaxing environment in which to spend a few days in Lagos.  And the food in the restaurant was good as well.  Locals gather here on a regular basis and I met some interesting people along the way.

Nuts - and noisy!!!!,"This small hotel is crazyyyyy.  Like the bathroom in my room was made out of seashells that were peeling off the wall.. There were two plugs and one of them gave me a shock, the other one was dead.  The bed smelt of damp, ciggies, beer, sweat, people..  But wtf. Its a wonderful hotel. The staff are funny as only Nigerians can be, with that balance between resignation and hope, love and fear.  The chairs in the lobby/eating area are mostly profoundly uncomfortable, the tables wobble, the floor has potholes, the serving hatch in the bar is a window, the window is a door and door is a shelf.  You can get a beer but where's the opener? Nothing is particularly fast, the extension cable is plugged into the socket with a biro and some masking tape.. this is exactly as it should be.",December 2016,,,wrote a review Nov 2017,"Oxford, United Kingdom","['106 contributions', '121 helpful votes']",50,[]
"Boutique Hotel, nice atmosphere, breakfast buffet needs work","Bogobiri House is a beautifully decorated boutique hotel centrally located on Lagos Island. The rooms have an individual flair and range from the sufficiently spacious to the very generous. The lobby serves as a lounge and is a great place to sit down and have a drink; more tables can be found in a small patio outside the entrance. The neighboring house doubles as a cultural center with concert and performance spaces and offers an interesting library, Nigerian video film collection and art collection. Bogobiri also has a good restaurant. The breakfast buffet is rudimentary and needs improvement, considering the prices.",October 2017,,,wrote a review Oct 2017,"Frankfurt, Germany","['49 contributions', '20 helpful votes']",40,[]
a great vibe with a wonderful african flavor,"Went with some friends visiting from Europe on a Thursday for the open mic night. where audience get to participate either with spoken word, singing etc.... it was great fun but the place was packed and gets quite rowdy, so if you're going on a thursday get there early ( before 7pm) and go with friends. there is an entrance fee of 500 naira to the open mic night. Really nice unusual african furniture , great decor and artwork on the walls with a great african vibe.  there's are souvenir / art shop within the premises with a good variety of items which was still open when we left at 10pm food was tasty, I had the grilled fish with yam chips and a peri sauce, others had boneless chicken with regular chips and same peri sauce. prices are reasonable.

"Art, Entertainment, and Food!","By far the best hotel accomodations we experienced during our trip to Nigeria (Lagos & Calabar). Other hotels were fine, but run-of-the-mill at best. This is a very unique experience, with amazing art and an incredible lounge next door. The one tip: the executive (?) suite with the big tub looks cool, but is a little awkward, with the toilet being expose (to both eye and nose). It cut down a bit on the romance factor. Just get the ordinary room and the value is amazing.  If you're there on a Thursday night don't miss the open mic at the lounge.

Upon entry your greeted to a low lite, wooden interior, walls adorned with art, friendly staff and a house band. The menu covers some local classics and the bar is well stocked with cold beers. Stayed around for an excellent bowl of peppered fish soup, a couple of beers and a few Bob Marley covers. Left feeling very satisfied  with the laid back atmosphere, quality music and cold beers.

I love this place!,"I visited Lagos on business.  The office staff had planned to take me to dinner at the Intercontinental Hotel restaurant, but I just couldn't face another hotel dinner.  I insisted on someplace different, and so we came here.  The food was great and the music even better.  This is SO my kind of place.  Funky, a great DJ with cool tunes, crammed bookshelves.  I used to hang in Hillbrow in Jo'burg in the nineties and this place has that kind of bohemian feel.

"Excellent Food, Artworks and Live Music","This is by far the best place to sample the local food specialities in a really cool setting amongst local art which really showcases a diverse range of paint / oil works and sculpture works, you can also enjoy a cold beer and listen to local bands cranking out a diverse range of tunes on Thursdays.

The bar where it's at,"You can't go wrong with the Thursday night open mic  jam at Bogobiri. The ambience is relaxed and upbeat; the music is laid back and intimate. Lolo comperes with aplomb, and sings up a storm with reggae soul vibes coming from the scratch band beside her. A decent range of standard drinks and a fair menu round it off. The  mixed crowd are as friendly and chilled as the service. Well worth a visit.",June 2017,,,wrote a review Jun 2017,"Cambridge, United Kingdom","['88 contributions', '36 helpful votes']",50,[]
A refreshing change,"I spent three nights here in June, whilst on business.  It is small, personable and just a lovely change to the normal hotels I stay at in Nigeria. I stayed in the Palm Room, which is beautiful: the bed is comfortable, there is aircon and a fan, with a stunning four poster and open plan bathroom.  Unfortunately the toilet area flooded, but this was resolved. Wifi is as good as at any other VI hotels. The staff make it - they are friendly and helpful, unlike the Eko or other hotels. I'm not sure I could return on business - it is a little ""too boutique"" but it has a wonderful creative vibe, and I loved my time here.",June 2017,,,wrote a review Jun 2017,,"['104 contributions', '118 helpful votes']",40,[]

"Very fun hotel, Open mic night is great!","This hotel is a wonderful place to visit in Ikoyi with a very fun open mic night. While the music was great and the variety of entertainers refreshing, it could be easier to place food and drink orders. So, be prepared for someone to hand you a drink menu but not come back, making it confusing. One other difficulty regarding food and drinks was that many items on the menu weren't available. This effected us more so than it might guests who aren't vegetartians but I think the vibe fore vegetarians would be to request ahead and if you stay there a while, they would probably get the beans and yams or pottage  on the menu for you. I think even the person from our group that isn't vegetarian would agree though that the food part of the hotel, while available and not bad, is an area",December 2016,,,wrote a review Jan 2017,,['2 contributions'],40,[]
Open mic fun,"We went for the famous open mic on Thursday. Decor was artsy with some vendors selling cultural wears and artifacts. Great music, lovely ambiance.

fun without food,"In a previous job I used to know this place as a gallery. Hearing it was some hang out now, gave me some artsy feeling. Décor met expectation. I was not looking for anything less. It was the open mic Thursday so arrived early enough. Food takes a while to arrive. What a wait! then the disappointment with grilled fish and chips was so gutting. it was tasteless and a rip off at the price. I love packed places. much as there is a decent crowd, it may pose some safety challenge should there be an emergency.

At times there might be just a few people there, enjoying a meal at others the place is rammed, with musicians playing in both bars.   As a hotel it is so much more interesting that the chain hotels.

It was my first time in Lagos and I hated to leave it so soon.  The only issue I had was with the restaurant service. It is a bummer that the breakfast included in the ""bed & breakfast"" price only has tea/coffee some pastry and fruits. Anything else you have to pay for. I had to pay extra for my eggs and sausages. One morning I made an order and 1 hour later , I had to order eggs yet again after the 1st waiter forgot. On my last morning , I walked to the restaurant at 7.30 and was willing to eat anything available but there was no bread or fruit available. I left at 8.10 having only had coffee.

Fantastic food if you can put up with slow service!,"What a cracking little place (didnt stay in the hotel, just ate there).  The atmosphere was fantastic.  Live music in the lounge which was loud enough to listen too but not too loud so's you couldn't have a conversation.    The food (that was available) was fantastic, don't go looking for the whole menu to be served because they will probably only have about 70% of the things on it.  While the food was great and plentiful, there were 8 of us, and we got our meals at different times, I think the first served were finished before the last meal arrived BUT  i repeat, the food was great!

Eccentric hotel in Lagos,"This is a small boutique hotel in lagos. If you love African art, sculptures and traditional pieces then his hotel is for you. It is a three minute walk from awolowo road so first bank, eateries and galleries are within easy reach. Wifi here is of good speed, and reliable. Food here is average for Lagos standard.  A complimentary breakfast comes with ever room. Its pretty basic; one croissant, tea or coffee and papaya fruit salad.

Review of restaurant on open mic night,"I've never stayed at Bogobiri but I go there often for the open mike night which is every Thursday night from 7pm. The place is really nice with a lot of potential. It's got a nice rustic, artsy feel about it which I guess attracts various artist & creative youngsters. However, I've found that the more popular this place has gotten, the more bad experiences I have. There was a time when going there & having a great time was a guarantee. Now I almost feel like I want to stay away. Firstly, Bogobiri is located on a narrow road whith absolutely no parking services. So people double park illegally on the road. This makes accessing the place almost impossible & causes a lot of unneccessary hold up. Simply put- parking over here is a nightmare!!!

Fantastic atmosphere,"I will have to start by saying I didn't stay here so I can't assess it as a hotel, although I would happily stay there in future. As a bar and restaurant though I can't provide enough praise. The food is excellent, the drinks are ever flowing and the staff and management are phenomenal. It's a great place to meet new people, listen to good music and relax- which can be difficult in the hustle and bustle of Nigeria. I came here at least a few times a week while I was living in Nigeria and would recommend anyone visiting Lagos to definitely spend an evening there.",September 2012,,,wrote a review Aug 2013,"Toronto, Canada","['21 contributions', '25 helpful votes']",50,[]

This is a difficult place to rate: what's the benchmark?,"I have stayed in total probably 1,5 months in Bogobiri, extended in 3 or 4 periods of 2 weeks. I find Bogobiri difficult to rate, just because it's so different from a regular hotel. I a way, this is not a hotel but more a bar (with live music every evening) where you can rent some rooms.  Other reviewers have described well the interior. Some of the staff are friendly. Some I find are not. Some do not care and prefer watching the football matches broadcasted in the bar area. Breakfast is included in the hotel price but very very basic, and if you are in a hurry early morning do not expect breakfast to be ready to enjoy all of the time. Internet is also included but quite shaky in times. I like the food (basic, generous portions) but not all what is presented on the menu is",May 2013,,,wrote a review Jul 2013,The Netherlands,"['95 contributions', '34 helpful votes']",30,[]
"""I want to love this place, but... v. 2""","I have to agree with an earlier review of this hotel and say it doesn't live up to its potential It's a charming and eccentric guest house and I loved the art on the walls, plus compared to other places in Lagos, it's (relatively) well priced. It had free wireless which is always a bonus. The staff are helpful and friendly which provides a comforting haven after braving the Lagos traffic all day.  However, I didn't have warm water for a decent shower and the breakfast was hopeless. I tried to have dinner there 2 evenings, and none of my first choices were available. If you're looking for a place to stay that has charm, is clean and that isn't as high-priced as the chain hotels, I can certainly recommend it. If your expectations are higher, you might be disappointed.",June 2013,,,wrote a review Jun 2013,"Cambridge, Massachusetts","['9 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",30,[]

I want to love this place but...,"I want to love this place and give it 5 stars because it has all the potential. The art and decor are really original and create a nice atmosphere and the staff are fairly good. But, like most hotels in Nigeria, it is a massive let down, especially considering it costs $200-a-night. Bad things: there was no hot water, the aircon didn't work, the breakfast consisted of some stale bread and cheap jam and instant coffee with condensed milk. Sorry, it's just not good enough! For the money you spend some quirky art and bohemian vibe just isn't enough if you can't provide the very basics given such a huge fee. If it was $50-a-night I'd accept all the faults.",April 2013,,,wrote a review May 2013,"London, United Kingdom","['50 contributions', '51 helpful votes']",20,[]
Great Restaurant,I did not stay at the hotel. I had a lunch buffet during a bus tour of Lagos.   It seems to be a popular spot for the locals. They have free wireless throughout the property. It is a great spot for business meetings.  I thought the food was good. African buffets are different than American buffets. American buffets are more abundant. We ran out of food at our buffet lunch. I should have eaten first instead of taking photos. Is you snooze you lose.  I was most impressed by the African Art and creative of the place.,February 2013,,,wrote a review Mar 2013,"Washington DC, District of Columbia","['391 contributions', '39 helpful votes']",50,[]
Hotel of African Art,"Have read a lot about Bogobiri Hotel and decided it was time to try this place out on my next trip to Lagos especially after my usual place of stay was unavailable. Bogobiri Hotel is right in the center of the city in the Ikoyi District and the first thing that struck me was the lack of outdoor space which was very much not as expected especially from what I heard or saw in pictures. Despite this however they make use of the little space they have quite well with outdoor sitting arrangements and shops. The hotel is a beehive of activity on certain days so not ideal if you are seeking a quiet getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. The African art work that is everywhere brings a rustic sense of feeling to the hotel. The rooms are clean, toilets average and food average.",February 2013,,,wrote a review Feb 2013,kaduna,"['65 contributions', '43 helpful votes']",30,[]
Best hotel in Africa,"When traveling over here I end up either at an overpriced 5 star hotel that falls short of my 5 star standards or at a place where I've got my own mosquito net and pad lock. This is the first African boutique kind of hotel that feels Africa, yet it's still totally clean and comfortable. Good service by reel people, rather than the usual where you feel like you have servants that are just really bad at there jobs. Live bands downstairs. All around good vibes.",February 2013,,,wrote a review Feb 2013,,['4 contributions'],50,[]
Truly a hidden treasure,"this place is great, Ive stayed at the bla-bla Ibis hotel and the really fancy Wheatbaker resort just down the street. Both are fine but as far as feeling like you're actually in Nigeria and not some sterile airport hotel the Bogobiri House is the place to go.   Most importantly the staff is super friendly, the vibes are areasom and the rooms are nice and clean.

Okay. But this is Lagos.,"I stayed at Bogobiri in December 2011 for ten days on business. The hotel is fine. For Lagos. Which isn't saying much. The rooms - I stayed in several - were rather dingy and in need of sprucing up and a good clean. The food varied wildly: excellent jollof rice one day followed by watery, insipid pepper soup the next. The principal attribute of the place is the interesting mix of people passing through the bar on evenings. I was taken out by a group of (Nigerian) strangers two weekends in a row after striking up conversations at Bogobiri. They made my stay frankly. The live music was okay - too many Bob Marley hits and not enough Highlife. Apparently some of the big Nigerian artists play here but I didn't see any. Just make sure you've got a room on the first floor and not",January 2012,,,wrote a review Dec 2012,Paris,"['4 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",30,[]
"Hidden Treasure in Ikoyi, Lagos",I was a bit apprehensive when I approached Bogobiri nearly three weeks ago on a rainy Sunday morning having arrived from Abu Dhabi for my first time in Lagos.  The outside did not reveal what the inside had on offer!!!  My check in was smooth and trouble free and Ugo was on hand to check me in despite it being her off day.  Initially checked into a room which had a slight problem with the AC and then was moved to another room just for the day but I made it mine for the next three weeks.  The room was spacious with a cane two seater and two single seaters and a large glass table which was more than enough for my work which I had plenty to complete in three weeks.  The place is owned by a superb Nigerian - Chike who stays on site and is an Aston Villa fan!!

Intimate and fun.,"In the chaos and bustle of Lagos, this is a tranquil and laid back place to stay.  The friendliness of the staff and the service they provide was the best I received in Nigeria.  The food was excellent - although the soups are toward the far end end of the blow-your-head-off heat scale.  The room was clean, quirky and very comfortable.  There was live music the night I stayed and the bar/restaurant quickly filled with smartly dressed locals enjoying the music and the close, intimate vibe.",July 2012,,,wrote a review Sep 2012,"Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom","['4 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]
"Great vibe, nice people, reasonable price","I can't recommend this place more. It is NOT a four star hotel, but it gives you a true Lagos experience. There used to be a really nice restaurant/bar across the street that played brilliant live music, including afrobeat legend Tony Allen. If this place is still around, that makes Bogobiri worth it, all on its own. Even if it's not, there are good restaurants within easy walking distance on Awolowo Road. Don't bother trying to drive if there's a go-slow (traffic jam) you'll hoof it faster on foot.",August 2011,,,wrote a review Jul 2012,Ottawa,"['32 contributions', '25 helpful votes']",40,[]
Something like a home from home,"My third trip to Lagos saw me seeking out this guesthouse which now has a second venue attached - Bogobiri House II. Just as welcoming as the original 10-room boutique Bogobiri hotel, Bogo II has a large live music room, a back terrace, six new guest rooms, plus the upstairs Nimbus Art Centre, which was getting its finishing touches for an end of June opening when I visited. In a nutshell, this place is a real Ikoyi find. Whether they know it or not, the owners have hit on a winning formula, with Nigerian and other African art displayed throughout both venues, live music most nights (from many of Nigeria's lyrical pioneers), an enticing restaurant menu, friendly staff and an international palette of guests from writers, to musicians, artists, business people or just regular",May 2011,,,wrote a review Jun 2011,"London, United Kingdom","['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
A hidden gem? Oh please.,"It's tough to find decent - and decently priced -  hotels in Lagos, and you could do worse than the Bogobiri. But it's no longer what it's cracked up to be in the guidebooks or on some of the reviews here.  True, Bogobiri goes for African cachet, with art on the walls and a mini restaurant that hosts local musicians. But the rooms are in desperate need of a face-lift, and management no longer seems to care.  In mine, the furniture was worn, the bathroom fixtures were falling apart, the closets looked dirty, and I had to fix the Venetian blinds myself to make them work. Halfway through my stay, the bed literally collapsed; a receptionist said it could not be fixed because it was a weekend. There were no lamps except one very bright, ugly ceiling lamp.  Bogobiri's staff is nice",October 2010,,,wrote a review Oct 2010,"Paris, France","['27 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",20,[]
This place is really nice,"My experience at Bogobiri was very nice. I stayed there for four weeks and i must say, it beats the experience I have had in most the hotels in Lagos. So much originality, culture, art and the staff are very helpful. The food is really good. Live music on some days. This one of the hidden gems of Lagos.

the boutique hotel with a uniquely Nigerian twist,"I arrived at Bogobiri House, for what would prove to be an extended working trip to Nigeria. To say that the hotel is a home from home, does not fully reflect the overall experience; what Bogobiri House does so well is give residents African hospitality at its very best.  It does not take long for the friendly and efficient staff to remember your name and particular preferences. My room was clean, always immaculately made up and room service was speedy and where necessary discreet.  On a practical level, the hotel did not suffer, by virtue of  fully operational back up generators, from lapses of of light and electrical power which is a frequent problem in Lagos.   In terms of decor, all the rooms were beautifully appointed with locally made furniture and the very best",February 2010,,,wrote a review Jul 2010,"London, United Kingdom","['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
Not up to the hype,"I found this boutique hotel through Lonely Planet and researched elsewhere to make sure it was the right place for us. I was disappointed in the reviews of this place on this site. I felt (and had backup from my boyfriend to make sure I wasn't off my rocker) for $230 a night it was a complete rip off. Now I realize Lagos, NIgeria is expensive but c'mon. This place was ""cute"" and ""quaint"" but very ill equipped and not maintained well at all for the price. The rooms were spacious and the artwork was generous. Common area was funky and worth a look with live music on Fridays. I felt that the rooms weren't as clean as I'd like. When you see a can of Raid for your use in the bathroom, there might be an issue.

"Friendly, personal touch","This is a well hidden gem, right in the heart of Lagos. You wouldnt really know it was a guesthouse from the outside. But you walk in, and its such a lovely, warm and very relaxed environment. The rooms are all individually designed in an afro-centric manner, with lots of interesting local paintings and art for sale hanging on the walls and at the weekends they have poetry recitals and live music in the bar area. I found that it was a bit of a hub for young, professional ex-pats looking for something a bit different. All in all a good stay, great food at good prices and the staff made life a lot easier with help and advice. Will definitely be heading back there next time I'm in Lagos.",January 2010,,,wrote a review Feb 2010,quintessentially,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
"Disappointed, after having read the reviews and staying there","After reading the reviews on TP of this I thought I had found just the place in Lagos.  Unfortunately, I’d have to strongly disagree with all the 5 star reviews.  The rooms (I checked out two) are large but not very comfortable or well maintained/equipped.  The common area is small, smoky, and the table tops are sticky with beer residue (when I checked in, I got a whiff from the lobby area and it smelled like a pub – not that I’d mind, but not if that is the only common area outside your room).  The art is good, but frankly I wouldn’t care if it was there or not – I was looking for a good place to stay.  I had planned on staying for a week but checked out the next day and moved into a proper hotel.

A quirky hotel that I liked a lot,"This hotel is something different, and is on a quiet road, with a real feel of an African Art gallery. I was stunned by the quality of Art both outside and inside the building and was particularly impressed with the steel horse outside , and the front door whilst welcoming is obviously secure. You access the hotel through a small front garden with parking to the side and go straight into reception and the bar area. This area kept my interest for quite a while, looking at the pictures and photos as well as sculptures in the bar. There is wi-fi Internet access through the hotel in bars and the rooms. The whole building keeps interest and for followers of African art is well worth seeing even if you just pop in for a drink. Bedrooms also are spacious and clean, with comfortable",April 2009,,,wrote a review May 2009,Hereford UK,"['127 contributions', '109 helpful votes']",40,[]

Bogobiri House - best hotel find in Lagos,This Lagos boutique hotel was a great find.  It was recommended by a friend and I was not disappointed.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the service was generally good.  Its a great oasis of calm and comfort in the hustle and bustle of Lagos.    The food was very tasty though could be a little spicy.  Most evenings there is live music which was just so lovely.  My room was beautifully designed with  lots of local art on the walls  It only has 10 rooms so I would advise you book early.  I highly recommend this hotel to someone who prefers the smaller hotel with character rather than the big chains,April 2008,,,wrote a review Jul 2008,UK,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",40,[]
