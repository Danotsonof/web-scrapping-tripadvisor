PERFECT STAYCATION WITH GREAT MEMORIES,"Nice ambience with very clean environment. Though we were stopped at the gate, found out its a routine security verification thing - which we totally understand and appreciate. (Safety first) The front receptionist were warm and professional. There is awareness for covid-19 and protocols were being followed. The staff were courteous, very cheerful and willing to assist at all time. Love the decor from the lobby to the room. The rooms are beautiful, yet cozy apartments with kitchenettes. Also enjoyed the food as they offer a blend of Nigeria and continental dishes and of course I always look forward to the breakfast spread.  We would surely return and as well recommend to my friends always. Such an amazing place to be. Please keep it up.",August 2021,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Aug 2021,,['1 contribution'],50,[]
