"Bad Service, Bad website, Bad hotel","This is a very terrible hotel! We booked online got there and was told their website isn’t working and that we don’t have rooms available. We were told to pay extra 15,000 to get a room. We were left stranded. Bad bad bad hotel! The customer service is absolutely poor!

Best choice,We loged here on 6/6/18 on our way to Cape Town. The proximity to the international airport made it a must stay for us. We were treated very well from arrival up to the time we checked out on 7/6/18. Blue lodge naturally the best choice for travellers going to parts unknown.,June 2018,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Jun 2018,,['6 contributions'],40,[]
My stay in Blue Lodge Hotel Ikeja,I was pleasantly surprised at the ambient and the rooms. A good value for its price. Very convenient for catching a very early morning international flight or arriving very late into Lagos from another country.,December 2017,Traveled with family,No room specification I could observe,wrote a review Jan 2018,"Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria","['10 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40']"
The challenge to TripAdvisor to introduce a 'Good' rating remains unanswered,"Returning from upcountry by car and being scheduled to fly out of Lagos later in the afternoon, did the organizers of the Nigeria Travel Week book me a dayroom at the Blue Lodge Hotel to freshen up and change into my travel clothes.  Check in was instant and so was being shown to my room on the first floor. The room was clean, lights worked as did the air condition and most important, the water in the shower was hot and the pressure high. It turned out that the shower cabin in fact had body jets too, which were most welcome, having stepped into the shower all sweaty after a morning of travel by car.  I had three hours before my departure transfer and managed to get some work done as the WiFi worked well.  This was not a fancy branded hotel but it was right at the airport and it",November 2017,Traveled on business,I had a day room and could therefore not make an informed comment about better or less preferable...,wrote a review Dec 2017,"Kampala, Uganda","['3105 contributions', '496 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
AVERAGE HOTEL,"The room was neat, room service could be improved on. The dining room could be upgraded. There was no swimming pool, this was a big minus. The location is relatively peaceful, and is very close to the International Airport.",September 2015,Traveled on business,Not really sure if there are any special tips.,wrote a review Jul 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['32 contributions', '51 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30']"
"Helpful staff, Clean environment.","Spent a night at the Blue Lodge, enjoyed the stay. Large double room, very decent and clean. The staff were very helpful and kind, which was really reassuring after a long journey. Restaurant is open 24hrs, which  is super for late night travellers; food is a bit expensive though.  I definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again.",March 2016,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Mar 2016,"Zurich, Switzerland","['4 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",40,[]
Last stop before heading home,"On our recent visit to Nigeria, we stayed at this hotel and to our delight, had a very enjoyable experience.  The room was very clean upon arrival and spacious.  Definitely worth the price.

Quite Simply Superb!!!,"I recently had the absolute good fortune to find myself staying at the Blue Lodge Hotel, Lagos for nearly 2 months, whilst in Nigeria on business. I have to say I cant find enough superlatives (wonderful, marvellous, excellent, incredible), to recommend this hotel!   As I spent quite a while at the hotel, I came into regular contact with the staff and I found them all incredibly courteous, friendly, helpful and attentive to all my needs.  All I'll say is if you ever find yourself in Lagos and need to stay at hotel near the airport then this is most definitely a must.",October 2015,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Nov 2015,"Greater London, United Kingdom","['4 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
Beyond Expectations,"Having travelled quite a lot of times across Africa, I have been more and more sceptical about hotels close to airports and their services, because of a sense of complaisance. However, the staff at the Blue Lodge Hotel were outstanding and always ready to help with any query I had. While out on business one needs a bit of empathy in the services offered and they outdid themselves in that department.  The communication flow with the hotel reservation staff was efficient and we didn't have to call so many time to know where and how the process will be when we arrive in Nigeria. The concierge made sure that my room was always clean since I had a step over before venturing in couple states and then should return for a longer stay. And, even better was that I liked my room on arrival",November 2014,Traveled on business,"The hotel has various type of rooms, but I would suggest one that gives you the view of the...",wrote a review Feb 2015,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['13 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
Good location and Efficient Service,"This hotel is perhaps the closest good quality lodging to the airport. It is in a nice, safe and secure area of Ikeja. They have constant electricity. The room was well kept except they need to fix the leaking tap on the wash hand basin. Reservation was quite simple and effective.  We did it from a smartphone and it worked! We enjoyed our stay. Our little 5 year old daughter insists we should go back! The staff were excellent especially the receptionist, the barman from Benue and Chucks. Overall, as good as the best in the world.

"Blue Lodge Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos.","Very good location approx. 300 Meters to the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos. Free WiFi internet access, neat rooms and excellent Nigerian food.

Good Location and Efficient Service,"Being close to the airport, this hotel has an ideal location for passengers on transit. The staff are friendly and helpful, however there may be a need to check the assigned room before check in. My family and I ended up in a room with a broken bed and non functional air conditioner. Having traveled far we just ate and crashed for the night. The staff were however very apologetic in the morning and said we would have been assigned another room if we had drawn their attention to it.  The food was good and I still consider it a convenient, well located and safe hotel to be in while in Lagos.",December 2013,,,wrote a review Feb 2014,"Abuja, Nigeria","['22 contributions', '26 helpful votes']",30,[]
Comparable to hotels anywhere in the world. Excellent staff & service.,"The hotel is in a nice, safe & secure part of Ikeja. I will definitely book this hotel again due to its close proximity to the airport, caring staff and excellent service. Their is constant supply of electricity and the room wifi  service was excellent. I also enjoyed the pick up at  and the drop off at the airport. No mosquitoes or flies in any part of the hotel.

Second time still ideal accomodation for Lagos,"Stayed at the Blue Lodge again with my family for a weekend,  Like stated before the location is great for business on Lagos mainland.  Also has a fairly easy access to Lagos Island.  Rooms were clean and hotel staff were very polite and helpful.  Safe location - had a great nights sleep throughout with no worries.  The breakfast, lunch and dinner were great.  We hung out with friends in the lounge and got good service - all the way.  This time in addition - noted the surround sound system in the hotel and the airconditioned stairways - great when coming in from the hot Lagos weather.  The hotel staff accidentally broke a bottle of our Moet Champagne - we let it go.  Also noted this time that there was no formal laundry services - though the hotel provided an iron on request.",April 2013,,,wrote a review Apr 2013,"New York City, New York","['80 contributions', '38 helpful votes']",40,[]
"Terrific stay, will always be my 1st choice","I stayed here about a week ago, and will certainly be staying here any time i'm back in Lagos.This lovely hotel is very clean and attractive, with great staff that are both friendly and courteous. The efficient front desk staff and seamless check-in process, allowed me to get into my room quickly, which is just what I needed after a long  flight. The room was fresh, clean and spacious, and appears to have undergone some tasteful renovation in the not too distant past. Very comfortable beds, with high quality guest amenities, large LED Tv with a whole lot of channels to choose from. The free wireless Internet was great and much appreciated, as I was able to stay in touch with my family. The hotel is right beside the airport, but I never heard a single airplane.

Close proximity to the International and Local Airports,"Spent two nights here on my way into Lagos and out.  Nice boutique like hotel hidden besides the International Airport - with a very homely feel to it.  Food is great and staff are polite and helpful.  Lots of art work in the hotel.  Free wifi but had difficulty with the speed.  Lounge at the back is nice, with an inner room for private meetings/relaxation.  Room is spacious and well furnished.  Hotel management stay onsite to ensure everything runs smoothly.  Enjoyed my stay and will definitely be back.",October 2012,,,wrote a review Oct 2012,"New York City, New York","['80 contributions', '38 helpful votes']",40,[]
Next door to the Lagos International Airport,"Literally 300 meters from the international airport in Lagos. Very secure, clean hotel with courteous staff and good service. I liked the fact that I didn't have to pay for WiFi as it's free for guests. The food is excellent and is a mixture of continental and Nigerian dishes...loved the chicken piccata! Enjoyed the in-house BBQ which they do on certain weekends and is FREE for guests. They offer a protocol ""meet and greet service"" which came in handy on my arrival as they were waiting for me at the airport. They also checked me in, and fast tracked me through immigration on the way out. Will definitely being staying there when I come back to Lagos.",July 2012,,,wrote a review Sep 2012,"London, United Kingdom","['7 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
2 minutes drive to the airport & very nice,I did an online booking & everything worked well - quick confirmation email & they did not ask for credit card number. they arranged airport pick up & drop off at 2000 NGN which is the standard rate. juice on arrival & very nice room. nice staff. only problem I had: the credit card machines were not working! but they were nice about it & made no problem to send someone with me to the airport when I was leaving & I could withdraw cash from the ATM at airport.,May 2012,,,wrote a review May 2012,"Dakar, Senegal","['28 contributions', '22 helpful votes']",40,[]
Nice and clean transit hotel which is so close to the international airport,"Nice and clean transit hotel which is so close to the international airport, in fact it was a fast trip to Lagos and I was so worried about the traffic specially from the airport to the town. The hotel in general is so clean, fully furnished with full wi-fi services !! the food is nice and the staff extremely friendly.
