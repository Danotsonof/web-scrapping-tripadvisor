PERFECTLY PERFECT,"My friend and I stayed at this amazing hotel with all it's amazing staff end of April 2018. The best way to sum up our experience is: ""Lagos was not on the travel list for 2019 BUT due to our stay at Angle Villa in April this year, we are looking into traveling back somewhere in 2019 and there is no doubt that Angle Villa is a must!"". The level of detail and care... The attention to detail that the staff puts into each and every guest' stay is so amazing it is beyond my comprehension. I just soaked it all up and loved every second of being made to feel like I was someone important. I highly recommend having drinks at their chic, cozy, classy cigar lounge, CLOUD 9! - We had an amazing time every night we were there. The food was awesome considering, I'm such a fussy one when it",April 2018,,,wrote a review Jun 2018,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
Low value for money,"This hotel is needlessly expensive. Receptionist was not polite and not helpful . Quality of service is terrible.  Bed size is small for the comfort plus room. Air conditioner not appropriately placed, so get ready to be down with a cold. Infact, no value for money!",April 2018,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review May 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria",['2 contributions'],10,[]
Very Tasty Food,"Friend and I visited the restaurant. Ordered the longer throat platter (Yam chips, French fries, roasted snail in hot sauce, meat balls, fried plantain, gizzard, chicken) all freshly served. It's the best food I've had in 2016. Highly recommended for spicy for lovers. One platter enough for 3.",September 2016,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Sep 2016,"Abuja, Nigeria","['85 contributions', '73 helpful votes']",50,[]

Cool Ambience Awesome food,"Was there two days in a row for the food, 7th and 8th of February. Really impressive Architecture, It really is an aptly named building.  And now the Experience!  Orders take a while to come thru but the food is worth the wait.   The cocktails are just a little bit above the average because they took our preferences into consideration when preparing our cocktails that makes them a good choice for me.  First time I visited, they had a little baby shower going, and surprisingly it wasn't intrusive. I and my friends were able to have a good time and the other diners that were taken to the sports viewing seemed to have had an enjoyable time too... Really nice place.   The food looked really nice and full of flavor, I had grilled prawns and vegetables with mashed potatoes on the",February 2016,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Feb 2016,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria","['27 contributions', '28 helpful votes']",40,[]
