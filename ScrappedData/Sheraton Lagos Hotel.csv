Worth staying,Sheraton Lagos has been the go to option for our company. The hotel is extremely old but is huge and gives you a sense of calm in the chaos of Lagos. The restaurant staff are quite accommodating and there is security on each floor. The tennis court is the best in entire Nigeria and the gym is well equipped.,August 2022,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jul 2023,"Pune, India","['11 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",50,[]
Pay before you leave.,"Had to stay in this hotel for 4 hours as I had a long transit in Lagos. So the interest is to be able to rest. Checked in and had to pay for the room at check in. Ordered room service and then decided to have a quick sleep. I was awaken by a phone call from reception requesting me to pay for room service now as I was checking out in 2 hours. Then 30 minutes later, room service arrives with a credit card machine. All in all, I couldn’t rest which is the first purpose of taking a hotel room during transit. First time in my life I see such a behavior.

Suggest you prefer another hotel in Lagos,"The worst service ever not only in Africa, in the entire Sheraton or Marriot network. A simple food takes 1hrs to be delivered, sometimes even 90 minutes.

Excellence.,Had read a few negative reviews of this hotel. You are all wrong! I am coming towards the end of a 5 day business trip here and I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Every member of staff has been so very kind and helpful to me - EVERY one.

Lack of care.,"Back again to the Lagos Sheraton after trying the Radisson Blu for a couple of stays. Same old problems have returned - with no adjoining rooms despite requesting them during the booking process. Reception say that they can't guarantee adjoining rooms - which doesn't make sense when you are staying with two children under the age of 12. The suggestion that 'they will be alright' isn't reassuring after a long and tiring flight. We don't want an upgrade, we don't want a fruit basket (?!), we don't want two rooms vaguely close to one another - we just want an adjoining room when it's been requested in the booking. As one of the recent comments below states, the hotel does appear to have taken a slide. There is a damp odour along the 4th floor corridor. The rooms are old, crumbling",March 2023,,Arriving at the hotel after 6pm seems to result in them giving the adjoining rooms away to other...,wrote a review Apr 2023,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria","['79 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",20,"['Value bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_20']"
Poor value for money,"Pity, standards have drastically dropped at this hotel and the rates charged per night is not justified.

"OK and Close to the Airport, but could be More","The stay was generally ok. Nothing exciting to note, except that we came to have a restful stopover weekend but it was far from it. The noise from the music filtered into the rooms very freely even though we were on the 4th floor. The room we were given was next to the staff exit door and every time the door was opened and trolleys wheeled in it would seem as though someone was trying to open our door.

It was nice to see they treated one another with the same level of respect.  The shower water was lukewarm the first day, but this was corrected the next day without my needing to complain.

Need some improvement,friendly staff but there are several improvements that need to be seen from various angles.  1) the condition of the room with some scratches and worn furniture. the water from the faucet also looks unclean and safe to use.  2) breakfast with a charge rate of usd26 and a buffet that only serves the majority of empty glass noodle and fried rice without egg and meet inside plus most of other food is just potato and soup is not worth the price charged.  housekeeping team and other staff are the best. always greeting guests and also helping with any questions asked,January 2023,,,wrote a review Jan 2023,"Singapore, Singapore","['6 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",30,[]

DINNER AT SHERATON LAGOS HOTEL,Dinner was Lagos Sheraton on Tuesday 27th August 2021 was a dismal experience except for the company of my dinner companions. There were three birthday parties and the nose from each party was at a record high. That is understandable anyway.   The sour point of the evening was when we had to pay for dinner. There was only one option of payment which was cash. POS machines were not working. The ATM machines in the lobby were non-functional. I guess internet service is largely responsible for that.   Then Sekinat's surly attitude as well as her immediate boss in the Accounts Office left a lot to be desired.   I will certainly not be returning to Sheraton Lagos Hotel in a long time.

definitely not recommended,"Dear Tripadvisors, I traveled to Nigeria almost 6 days ago, and have been stayed in this Hotel since that day. To reach a dinning services, you should spend min. 5-6 minutes, if you are lucky. Phone is ringing during this time but no one responses. If you have enough patience, someone pick the call but not talk with you directly. You should try to communicate with them even after the picking up the call.  After this step, if you will succeed to give your order, you should wait min. 1-2 hours for the delivery. Unfortunately, this is not limited with this.

Worst Credit Department / Customer Service Treatment Ever!,"Well, on February 7 I used my Debit Card to check out of the hotel using a Pre Auth Form, the amount was put on hold, and not deducted, until the company transferred the amount to the hotel.  The company settled the payment on February 19; however, for some reason the credit department cannot allocate the payment! Does that even sound logic? According to them, the person handling the case was on leave, so they don’t know where he left things, and are asking us for a proof of payment, while the payment was made online, via their payment link!!! So how can’t they allocate the payment?!

A few staff were particularly attentive including Ibrahim who did an amazing job cleaning my room and ensured everything was done to perfection. Thanks to Friday at the pool bar for running a great bar. And Damilola B for great service. Thanks to Goke and Lynda in the lounge for looking after me at breakfast. As always Margaret George ensures all guests are all well looked after. I will return again and look forward to being taken care of at Sheraton Ikeja.",June 2019,,,wrote a review Jul 2019,"Dublin, Ireland","['38 contributions', '12 helpful votes']",50,[]

Good Hotel and Safe location in Lagos,First time in Nigeria and the hotel met my expectations. Clean rooms and friendly staff. The best paart is the restaruant choices that you have at the hotel are quite good with good food and nice atmosphere. I definitely recommend the outdoor restaurant by the pool side. For breakfast the buffet bar is good but crowded so if you can enjoy the amenities of the club floor level 6 is best.

Old dated rooms and mouldy bathrooms!,"I had a room on the second floor of this hotel. The rooms are dark with a very cheap laminate mock wood floors which has gaps in it everywhere. The furniture is very dated and scuffed and chipped. The overall decor of the room was bad. The cleanliness of the room was also suspect. There is tea and coffee making facilities in the room. The flat screen tv was of a good size with some good channels. Now the bathroom is like a relic from the 70’s! Very old bath, sink, toilet with 1970’s tiles. The bath has mould everywhere.

In need of some TLC,"Recently stayed in the Sheraton, Ikeja for the first time for 20 nights in a standard room on business. The reception area was very large and appeared to be a bright modern space which gave me hope that the rooms would not be the same mediocre standard that has come to be my usual experience in many hotels in Lagos that bill themselves as 'luxury'. Such hotels may, at some point in the distant past been able to claim such status but due to years of poor / no maintenance and refurbishment now would struggle to achieve 3 stars in the UK. Unfortunately the Sheraton also fell into this category of hotel for me. My room (see photos) had an extremely depressing outlook and inside was not much better.

Plenty of free tea and coffee in the room and a good supply of electrical sockets for the business traveller to recharge the necessary devices.

The room was big enough - king size bed, the decor is spartan and what is there is def dated. Grouting in the bathroom needs retouching.

"EXCELLENT HOTEL! GREAT STAFF, best place to stay in Lagos!","LOCATION The hotel is one of the closest international brandEd hotels to the main airport in Lagos and is therefore most popular with airline staff and expatriates and visitors generally. It is a mere 15 minutes drive from the airport, an Uber costs N4000 (about $10). I arrived at 8pm after a stressful two and a half hours drive to the hotel which is a mere 12km drive from the airport - a testament to the dire Lagos traffic situation. Temperature is about 30 degrees so it’s hot and when it rains it drenched you to soaking wet in seconds!  PARKING There is free parking on the premises and the hotel grounds are serene and secure.

Food choice is mostly international with the standard choices but they also have a local food section with few dishes that is delicious in my taste. Hot and spicy adept you will be in for a treat.  The buffet breakfast is excellent tough a bit pricey but the excellent staff here make it worth while. A special mention to Mrs GIFT who is always pro active and attentive to her customers need.

After many visits to Victoria Island hotels, this was my first ‘mainland’ stay in Ikeja.

I used room service for dinner a few times, and that was a good choice after a long and tiring day.

In-Room Dining and Service,"It is great to return to this hotel after a year away for business. Although it's quite an outdated hotel, it can make good use of a revamp but I would still applaud the in-room dining and d service by their room service staff for consistently delivering their best.  Portions of the food is always a lot, like 2 to 3 times more than a normal portion in Europe, for example. The quality is just as equally good, I like especially their pastas n pizzas, and I certainly love their local cuisine, my favourite is the chicken stew with jollof rice and fried plantains.

Close to the Airport with nice rooms,Sheraton Lagos looks like an old hotel from the outside. The interiors do make up for it to some extent. The highlight in the lobby is the pool table where you can spend evenings with strangers if you so wish to. The gym is situated away from the main hotel beyond the pool but it's well equipped. Food is average both at the restaurants and in-room dining. Service is helpful and courteous.,February 2018,,,wrote a review Feb 2018,"Mumbai, India","['197 contributions', '99 helpful votes']",30,[]

Pretty good,"Had a very good time over the Christmas holidays.  Shower was great. Staff were generally kind and helpful beginning with the reservations on to the Club floor and the main restaurant on the ground floor. Rooms were neither choked or overly spacious but every mod con was available including USB port. Shame about the satellite channels. Reception was fitful and I was hugely disappointed with the very limited choice of channels you really want to watch. Sheraton., you cannot provide Premium bouquet with the high room tariffs? I repeat, disappointing! The gym equipment was in tip top condition while the gentleman at the gym was great with guests.  Some drawbacks. Variety at the buffet was limited which is such a shame as the place was full most of the time.

The rooms need a bit modernising,"Nice enough hotel, up to the Sheraton standards. Big and clean swimming pool with a lovely outdoor restaurant. The rooms are a bit dated and in need of renovation, unless you are in the Executive Floor, where the rooms are new and modern. The bathroom was definitely in desperate need of modernising.  At night the loud music coming from the swimming pool area can be a bit annoying, especially as the sound is quite...distorted! The staff are extremely welcoming and friendly. A true reflection of the Nigerian population. I always enjoy the food served by the pool, even if it’s quite expensive, if you consider the prices outside the safety of the hotel.

Significant improvement seen in standard,"I had last stayed at this hotel many years ago , and the experience was so bad that I never considered it during subsequent trips . The biggest advantage of staying here is that it is close to the business hubs and the airport, and with the traffic in Lagos being what it is , that can save you considerable time . So this time , since time was short , decided to try it out .  Was a pleasant surprise therefore to see that standards have considerably improved. Being a Starwood Preferred Guest helped me through a breezy check in , and in no time I was in my room on the Club Floor . Though the room is on the smaller side , the decor more than makes up for it . Housekeeping was excellent , and so was the room service .

"Pillows from Harrods, Toilet roll from Poundland","Stayed in Lagos for 3 nights end of November, everyone said that the Sheraton is great (I didn't choose my hotel). I wasn't disappointed, the staff are super helpful and the room was excellent in every way, one thing i've never seen before is an exhibitionist shower (apparently that's what it's called) where the shower room is in full view of the bedroom, although there were pull across shutters if you wanted privacy. Another thing that impressed me was when i got back to the hotel at 2.45am and the bar shut at 3am the staff were willing to serve us later if we sat by the pool or in the lobby. I only had breakfast once which was great with plenty of choice, including some little chicken pieces which I loved.

Bad bad bad and unaccomodating,Stayed here 3 nights for Crusade prepaid the booking with a preference of having 2 single beds in our room as we were two men sharing the room. On arrival pre booked preference  was ignored and we were told that first thing in the morning a room would be made available for us. Nothing happened for any of the 3 nights we stayed there. My friend had to sleep on an uncomfortable mattress for three nights while we payed top dollar.   Come checkup the duty manager was unaccommodating and unhelpful and refused to reimburse some of the costs incurred while staying extremely uncomfortable. Reimbursed a fraction of the diner bill which equates to probably 1% of the total bill for our stay  Food took long and some meals were not as asked for.

Good Management staff but an old infrastructure,The hotel is almost 30 years old and are the rooms and interiors. Never felt a Sheraton experience until the duty manager provided me a free upgrade to the club rooms. I really appreciate this gesture from the duty manager.  Security checks and guards at each floor and elevator entries is commendable.  I would recommend only club rooms in this hotel to avoid disappointment. I was told by staff to book directly at the hotel desk for best prices rather using any travel website.  Pool bar is a good place to hangout. The staff was occasionally rude during the breakfast.

The bathroom features one of those horrid baths with the built in shower and shower curtain (in my humble opinion those should be banned worldwide from all 4 star and up hotels!).  I sat on my bed contemplating how i would keep clean without having to do the ""shower dance"" where you try and avoid touching the curtain whilst showering when my phone rang and i was advised of my upgrade",May 2017,,,wrote a review May 2017,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['10 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",40,[]

A decent hotel in West Africa,"The hotel, as a part of the Sheraton group, maintains a very good level of service, cleanliness and facilities. Compared to other 'International Branded' hotels in this region of Africa, the Sheraton Lagos have a good set of staff who are friendly, attentive and responsive to your requests.  Remembering that this is indeed a Nigerian City Hotel, it provides a relatively quiet atmosphere away from the outside hustle and bustle. Saying that, the bar and outdoor restaurant areas do get busy and lively over the weekend. The pool area is in need of renovation, although the pool itself is clean and well maintained. Some investment in the grounds are sorely needed. There are a few abandoned containers and other unsafe for children oddities near the 'jogging area'.

Faded former glory,"What can I say! The lobby area looks like it could do with a complete overhaul. It is so shabby and reeks of the 80's /90's. The cocktails were poorly done, The balance was off and it was sickly.  I was shocked to see a snooker table in the lobby, which is not the ambience you expect when you fancy a quiet drink.   The chairs look grubby and there is this sense of old, shabbiness that doesn't match the brand.   All in all, this place looks like it has been neglected and is trading on its former glory.

Comfortable,"The room was spacious and comfortable with nearly all the amenities that you could wish for.

The only real issue I have to list is the noise generated by the archway metal detector outside the hotel entrance. I understand the need for security, however the continual bleeping throughout the day and night was a minor inconvenience as the windows are not totally sound proof - much like the walls of the room.

SHERATON LAGOS/IKEJA still the best possible choice,Coming to Nigeria since 1976 I must admit that the Sheraton in Lagos just outside the Airport is still the best possible choice if you stay in Lagos. It has maintained its high standards over all the years I am visiting it and now with the newly renovated Club rooms in the 5th and 6th floor it is a stunning experience.

Betel than before...,"The Sheraton is supposed to be one of the better hotels in Lagos, Nigeria. Upon arrival in the evening we had too wait almost an hour for our room, because the hotel had a ' high occupancy' . Not such a good first impression. As a compensation we were offered a drink and a snack, but after a long journey you just want to go to your room. The room I got was quite convenient: good, hard shower, nice spacious bed, good working air conditioning , writing desk, good flat screen tv with free movie channels.  The breakfast restaurant is something else...furniture is really outdated ( or it has to be your taste), with dirty carpet. Buffet is good , but in such environment it just doesn't taste that good.

Much improved,"I have stayed at the Sheraton many times and have been critical that it was in need of modernisation, having stayed there again this week I am pleased to report that the newly refurbished bedrooms are up to date in appearance and of a very high standard. The bars and dining areas are acceptable but would benefit from being modernised. The hotel continues take security seriously and as a guest I always feel safe.

Great overall experience,Im a regular guest of the Sheraton Lagos hotel.I have always found it to be one of the most relaxing and friendliest hotels that Ive stayed in. The staff are always friendly and extremely helpful. The rooms on the upper floors(SPG) floors have been completely renovated recently  and having stayed in one of these new rooms I found it to be excellent in my opinion and comparable to the best that can be found in Europe so it makes Lagos a better experience. The fact that there are several bars and restaurants to choose from all within the one hotel complex makes for a good variety and is very good especially for long term guests as opposed to just a lobby bar which is all too common in many of the hotels in the area.

Oasis of calm with a great Nigerian flavour,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton Lagos last week. The top couple of floors have recently been renovated but I was below these floors and it was still very comfortable. I had a lovely view of the pool and my room was well appointed.   On Friday and Saturday nights the place goes off with a live band in the courtyard near the pool. I enjoyed the entertainment but it was quite loud in my room. If you are staying the weekend and you prefer peace and quiet, I would advise asking for a room on the other side of the hotel.   I thoroughly enjoyed the pool, pool bar and restaurant.

Yet again rooms not ready for check in at 9pm,"When I try to check in to a hotel around 21:00 on a pre-booked reservation, I fully expect the room to be ready.  As is becoming the norm, room is never ready as hotel allows day use of the room to airline staff which only check out around 20:30 then the rooms have to be cleaned and turned over.  Considering the price paid for an overnight stay, it is not good enough that evening guests whom have been travelling for 12/13 hours are made to wait in hotel lobby/smoky bar whilst room is serviced.

"Nice Place, Don't Think I'd Visit Again","I typically stay on Victoria Island when I stay in Lagos, as there are a number of very nice hotels there. This time I had an early morning flight back to Abuja the next day, so I decided to try the Sheraton which is close to the Airport.  It started badly - when I arrived at 9am, immediately the clerk wanted to charge $80 for ""early check-in"". Apparently the fact that they might have to clean a room warrants an $80 charge. He didn't say ""we don't have rooms available"" (which turned out to be the case), he wanted $80. I went to my office and checked in after 2pm.  When I got back, the staff was very very nice. Very pleasant and professional. It made me begin to forget the earlier interaction, and the manager was particularly kind to us.

Food poisoning from pool bar,"I am now 9 days into severe food poisoning that occurred from eating a burger at the pool bar. I have been twice to this hotel now and the first time I experienced rude staff, this has improved. The food looks gorgeous, smells lovely and is presented well. As soon as I arrived back into the UK I had severe cramps and other symptoms that I do not wish to share. Once the Dr visited me and diagnosed the problem she came to the conclusion that the last thing I ate was a burger that was undercooked, poor hygiene by staff and now I'm still suffering with severe cramps still.

"Nice hotel for Nigeria, a bit far from downtown","When traveling to Lagos and Nigeria in general, hotel selection is critical. So many places look nice on their websites only to turn out to be rundown, dangerous snake pits. Fortunately, the Sheraton is as nice as it appears in the pictures and is one of the best in Lagos.  The hotel is about 20-30 minutes drive from the airport depending on traffic. To downtown, it can easily be an hour or more by road, especially if commuting during rush hours. If your work is taking you into downtown, you might want to consider something a bit closer.   Like most high end Nigerian hotels, the Sheraton is surrounded by high walls with plenty of security guards on site.

Great Hospitality !!!,"1) Good  and professional Check-In. 2) Introduction to the facilities. 3) Great pool area and Pool bar. 4) Excellent dinner options near the pool area for dinner ( Value for money buffet and Al la cart. 5) Room service delivery and attitude of staff towards service was outstanding.  6) Speed of delivery for room service was GREAT! 7) Hi- Speed Internet.  Out of all that I would really emphasis on the optimistic service attitude that the staff carries, I was surprised that they have such an organized F&B flow in their daily operation.

Secondly, for a city where high rates of crime are a problem and terrorism is a credible risk this hotel has terrible security.

The minute I arrived my main concern was security. The hotel looked quite secure with a good presence of security in the hotel. They have security on each floor at night as well. Perhaps my only suggestion is that the security shouldn't be sat right next to one of the rooms next to the elevator to respect the privacy of guests of this room.

But I must say the staff is wonderful and very helpful. This is a busy hotel with lots of travelers from around the world. The rooms are ok, I like the hard wood floors and I found the bed to be very comfortable. The food is good but outrageously expensive. You better have deep pockets to eat here. My girlfriend and I went to the pool bar one night to relax, we ordered large prawns and fries to share.... $50.00 not including drinks. A shared plate!!! The prawns were delicious but not worth $50. We also went to ""The Club"" for dancing. It was nice and we did have fun... But that will cost you $50+ for a drink or 2.

Not the usual standard of a Sheraton but OK anyway,"This Sheraton is indeed quite old and needs a lot of refurbishment but it can be enjoyed if you get things right :  1. Ask for a recently renovated room which then will be of a decent standard if you do not take into consideration the bathroom which was not renovated yet. There might be more renovated rooms on the SPG floor (4th out of 6 floors). 2. Enjoy the swimming pool and the sport facilities 3. Appreciate the hospitality and friendliness of the staff 4.

The room was well appointed, though the corridor was a bit cramped. The bed was comfortable, and allowed a good night's sleep. The good thing was that breakfast opened at 5.30am and we could still grab a bite before rushing for the airport.  The dinner buffet by the poolside was great too. They were serving Chinese food and we found it quite delicious. Though I could not use other facilities due to my very short stay, the gym was supposed to be closed for week or so for maintenance.

Tired Sheraton in Lagos.,"This hotel has been a magnet for travellers, businessmen and women and Nigerians for many years. It used to have a certain buzz about it, always busy, somewhat dated, but with little competition, it was the only place to go. No longer. There's a brand new hotel across the road and it's stealing some of the Sheratons buzz.  Some rooms have been upgraded, laminate flooring and some newer furniture. There have been recent problems with air conditioning at the hotel. An upgrade is underway, and if my room during my last visit was anything to go by, it's rather fierce and keeps rooms uncomfortably cold even when switched off!

Good hotel for Lagos,"You can't review a hotel in Lagos without a pinch of salt.  I've stayed in 4 different hotels in Lagos over time and only the Sheraton and Protea in Ikeja are worth staying in.

I always thought the food at the Protea was also superior to the Sheraton, but after my last visit, I think the Sheraton outshines the Protea in the food department - more restaurants, better quality and variety.

The pizza's in the mock-Italien at the back are about the best value..... oh and the breakfasts are pretty good too.  that's about all i would recommend - there are so many better local places nearby.,May 2012,,,wrote a review Aug 2012,"London, United Kingdom","['195 contributions', '119 helpful votes']",20,[]
Overpriced and needs updating,"This hotel is maybe the worst value or the money I have ever known.  Granted, Lagos is an expensive city, but this hotel is a 2 star for its quality for a 5 star price.    The food is passable at best, and again, incredibly overpriced.    The rooms are in dire need of updating.  Good points of is hotel:  the staff is caring, sweet and very accommodating.  They will make you want to stay around just to be with them.  Service is pretty good, and can be speedy at times.  The people are really great.  The security is also good, which is important in Lagos.    The Sheraton is in a great and convenient location, and it provides a clean and safe place to stay.  But it is simply not worth the money it costs to stay there.",April 2012,,,wrote a review Aug 2012,"Washington DC, District of Columbia","['14 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",30,[]

3-Star Comfort at a 5-Star Price,"I thought that great ‘Nigerian Scam’ was something on the internet, and that you got conned out of your money for a being a little naive and greedy. Now I know that it is probably more likely to refer to the hotels in Lagos and those of us naive enough to believe in value for money.   I booked at the Sheraton Hotel because I had been staying at Sheratons for decades without complaint and was advised by colleagues and other contributors to Trip Advisor that it was a ‘good choice near the airport’ and the ‘best choice in Lagos’.  But what a dump!! And it’s an introduction to purgatory if you are non-smoker. The rooms are terrible, drab and basic.

Prices are high, yes but you got to see this Sheraton as a business hotel (flying crews, and almost all companies send their staff to this hotel), so maybe not the best choice for a tourist experience.

SURELY OVERPRICED FOR THE SERVICE AND FACILITY,"I have stayed at this hotel for the past 6 years. I can really call a couple of the staff by name.  Generally, the hotel provides the best security that I know of, and it is for this reason that my organization normally chooses it for our business travel. The other plus is that the bed is quite good and the staff are usually very friendly. In terms of food, the hotel provides quite good menu, especially of the local dishes. There are a number of significant negatives though.  I find the hotel to be highly overpriced. They could charge as much as $450-500 or more for a standard room with no breakfast!

Very tired product for the price paid,"This was one of the most awful experiences I have ever had in a hotel. Granted, Lagos is not a place you would expect great hotels as it is not a touristic destination, but the hotel itself is old and for the amount we paid, it was far, far away from expected. Service breakfast was not bad at all as all ladies were very friendly, and I did feel safe in the hotel (which is very important in Nigeria, of course) although all security people carrying guns right in front of the lobby.

Very Poor,Just returned from another work trip and this place seems to have got worse.  The Bathroom appeared dirty with cracked tiles and some dubious stains on the wall around the toilet.  There were hairs in the bath tub suggesting that cleaning is of a poor standard.  Next to the bed was a wiring loom that had been wired into the back of the plug socket meaning that the socket plate was very loose on the wall (dangerous).  Lamp shades on the lights were very dirty and stained and the overall appearance was extremely poor.  Maybe because of safety issues in Lagos  this hotel has become complacent but it is definitely unlike any Sheraton that I have stayed in before.

The general staff are very friendly with the exception of a few staff members checking people in and out.  But I shouldn't generalize on them because one lady was very friendly checking in.

It's very good for Lagos,"The thing you pay for above all when you stay in Lagos is safety. It's a dangerous place and staying safe costs money.

Surprisingly pleasant with ver good if rather quirky service,"I stayed here for one night on Valentine's Night as it so happened and was very pleasantly surprised. Having read the reviews about how awful the rooms are I was delighted to find myself in a refurbished room on the Starwood Preferred Guest Floor. The hotel is a hive of activity and particularly so as it was Valentine's Day and there were lots of locals queueing to pay for the buffet/dance function that the hotel had organised by the pool. As I was alone I elected for a quiet meal for one in the Italian restaurant and the service and food was very pleasant.

Again down a drive, but this time the lobby and check-in area is indoors, giving a more secure feeling.  I had changed my booking: arriving aday early, and after calling to confirm this was OK, I was advised that since I had booked through the British Council, securing slightly better rates (very slightly) than the regular rate, I would have to pay in cash.  I could not withdraw cash on my corporate card, and certainly did not want to be roaming Lagos (regardless of whether I was in a hotel car or not) with that sort of cash on me, so when I arrived and explained that I could not pay in cash, expecting an arguement, the guy checking me in looked at me as though I was barking and told me",July 2010,,,wrote a review Jan 2011,,"['104 contributions', '118 helpful votes']",30,[]

This is a wonderful home away from home,"The great exerience commences from the moment you walk through the doors of the Sheraton.

Such variable quality for so much money!,"I stay at the Sheraton somewhere between 3 and 5 times a year for the last few years and each visit seems to be to a different hotel, although it's been mostly good (a few great stays even) the last couple of years. On this last trip, I was on an overnight stay transiting Lagos. There seemed to have been some overbooking so some discussion between check in staff, then I was ""upgraded"" to a room on the club floor. The musty smell hit me at the door but after a whole day travelling, I was not in the mood of arguing for a room change. So I went in. The room was from the early 90's, the TV from earlier.

Better than the alternatives,I've been staying in the The Sheraton Lagos on and off for twenty years and I feel it's still the best option in town.  The staff are friendly and willing to help when the inevitable problems arise and the security is very good indeed.  The food and bar outlets are reasonable and you are not pestered with unwanted guests as in other Nigerian hotels. Service can be a little slow but that's just the way it is - get used to it and it makes life a lot easier.  The prices are very high but in my view worth it purely because of the security.

Mold and stains on the tile. Not what you would expect of a Sheraton charging $300 plus per night.  But it is the only safe/secure hotel in Lagos in which to stay. You really don't have a choice . So they pretty much have a manopoly.  They do have a few nice restaurants (but expensive)  in the hotel and a nice pool area.

Good 4 star hotel but expensive,"We have just returned from a stay at the Sheraton and Towers Ikeja, Lagos Nigeria. We booked our towers room (6th executive floor) through the Starwood reservation system where we were told that the rooms on that floor had been refurbished. When arriving in our room (631) it was a complete dissapointment. Tiny bathroom with cracked sink producing yellow to brown coloured water, roomdecoration from the eightie's and smelly! My guess is that they only refurbished a couple of rooms to put on their site. On the other hand, staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the hotel. Food was excellent for Nigerian standards but pricy. Beautiful pool and very relaxing lobby lounge. This is really a safe haven in a crazy city and surely the n°1 hotel in town. Be sure to ask for a newly",January 2006,,,wrote a review Jan 2006,brugge-belgium,"['11 contributions', '64 helpful votes']",40,[]
"Make sure to ask for a ""newly refurbished room""","As ex-air crew, I stayed many a night in this hotel. As far as hotels in Lagos go, this one is fine (although I would not want to stay here for a holiday!) It is safe as long as you stay within the hotel complex. DO NOT venture out un-escorted even to the Chinese restaurant next door as there was an armed hold-up there last year!!  There is a HUGE difference between the renovated rooms and the older ones so do try to get one of the new ones. Trust me.  The gym is good, as is the pool area. They have live entertainment a few nights a week & themed buffets by the pool.    There is a small nail bar beside the gym and they do good pedicures for about $10 US. I think it's closed on Saturday or Sunday, so check with the front desk.  My biggest complaint about this hotel are the",May 2005,,,wrote a review Nov 2005,"London, England","['73 contributions', '119 helpful votes']",30,[]

Great and safe hotel of you need to be in Lagos,"Needed to go to Lagos for business reasons and was glad to stay in such a decent place. Security is not an issue with officers contolling all floors at night and a big room safe for valuables. A good choice for business travellers who need reliable phone and internet connection. The restaurant and business centre are fine - but the whole deal is somewhat pricey (as all hotels in Nigeria). The closeness to the airport makes it a very good choice (althouhg it is clearly not a typical airport hotel); however, if you need to do business in the Victoria Island area it may take some time through the chaotic Lagos traffic.",August 2005,,,wrote a review Sep 2005,"Berlin, Germany","['156 contributions', '281 helpful votes']",40,[]
Great hotel,"The hotel was great when i stayed for the month i visited.  Even though the people in the front desk were not the most pleasant they did not have bad attitudes.  The rooms were great i thought the beds and pillows were comfortable, and the shower was runing with good clean water.  Also there was every service u look for in a hotel available internets, great food, and a beautiful swiming pool.  I also have to put extra emphasis on the chef because the food was great and very tasteful.",September 2003,,,wrote a review Aug 2005,Hackensack New Jersey,"['3 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",50,[]
Not my ideal hotel,"Well I stayed there from the April to May 05 and I want to tell you that I was more than pleased when that plane took off for Frankfurt.  Some things to consider befor you go:-   1) Why are the staff working in the Goodies Bar, so surly, what a put off?   Why can't they smile, why could they not accept that there was a ""two for one"" special going for some brands of beers promoted by the hotel?   Why dont they play some decent music?  Why are they so slow to give you the docket for signing after purchase, in same cases 60 minutes later, makes one confused?  Why do they say the next evening you didn't sign the docket?   Why do they put the nibbles in the plate with their bare hand. Hygiene??   2)  Why are the prices their over the top, especially in the restautants.  3) Why is",April 2005,,,wrote a review May 2005,"Northcote, New Zealand","['43 contributions', '119 helpful votes']",20,[]

A surprised Experince,"It was a surprised expericence. I arrived Sheraton Hotel Lagos, I did not have a reservation, but I was able to get a room. The guy at the desk, was so professional that I was taken aback. He then notified me that I was able to get a christmas package, a reduced rate which was free dinner and breakfast. The dinner and breakfast was a feast! food from all over the world. He also informed me that I could pay with my visa or cash. I was somehow apprehensive but I gave it a shot. I payed with my visa. I spent a total of two days and I enjoyed every minute. Movies in the room, there was a bar named goodies inside the hotel and one night I left my room at 6 in the evening and came back 4 am the next morining and I did not leave the hotel. There was a club in the complex. Although it",,,,wrote a review Jan 2004,"Atlanta, Georgia","['1 contribution', '25 helpful votes']",50,[]
