Location and Staff,Excellent location and the staff of the hotel are going to be the reason for my next stay in Lagos. Breakfast was good and adequate. Clean rooms and comfortable beds and big size bath rooms are other reasons to book for this hotel again.,November 2019,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Dec 2019,,"['9 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
