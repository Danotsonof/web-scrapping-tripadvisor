With no doubt number 1 hotel in Lagos.,I have to say that it’s with no doubt the best hotel in Lagos and VI. I really enjoyed my stay . The view from my room was something else.

Comfortable stay in Victoria Island,I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I liked the swimming pool and its large enough to exercise and located facing the waterfront with great views in the evening.  The hotel looks like it's aging a bit so may not resonate if you like spit polished. The breakfast area also gets a bit crowded.   The location is great if you are on business in Victoria Island. Its close to some very good restaurants in Lagos.,February 2022,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2022,Maldives,"['68 contributions', '48 helpful votes']",40,[]

Good location and friendly staff,Good location and friendly staff. Tip for any travellers. I was giving a room on the ground floor this time facing the road and security entrance.

Thank you for that experience.  We deduct 1 point for: Facility in the rooms can be renewed such as in the bathrooms because it looks quite used.

AVOID! THIS IS NOT A 5*STAR HOTEL,The whole toilet and bathroom needs complete overhaul and changing. The toilet and bathroom is so dirty with mould in the shower head  and tap head. The water is dirty yellowy colour and the shower doesn’t drain out water properly hence the shower gets flooded when you shower. The sealant and grout have all turned  brown. The bathtub have turned brown. and the room have a mouldy smell. Toilet is so dirty and not properly cleaned. Something needs to be done about the facilities at this hotel cos it’s not worth the amount that is been charged at all. If there’s anything like a zero star that’s what I would rate this place. Please save your money and go somewhere else don’t be deceived by the front building.

The best staff and a great atmosphere,"I spent 1 week here and everyone I met were so polite and friendly. The staff remember you and really treat you as a part of their family. The hotel itself feels like it's a resort with the pool area (spotless) overlooking the water. The gym has the essentials (with a barbell) and is surrounded by nice plants. The decor is great. The food is amazing and buffet is available everyday with a range of options/changes throughout the week so you dont get bored, I had the buffet everyday just coz there were so many options).  A big shoutout to Beatrice working in the in-house restaurant and her colleague, I believe her name started with an A. They really looked after me and were genuinely happy to see me everyday.

Concierges and reservations desk were especially helpful at all times. The decor is on point. I loved how spacious the rooms were. Laundry services were quick and well done. Areas for improvement: As a vegetarian I had very few options although the chefs tried to come up with alternatives, special thanks to Chef Michael. I’d encourage the hotel to offer a wider array of veg dishes on the menu.

Sub Par from what was expected,"Be prepared to wait forever for everything. Check-in takes a long time, not as smooth as some other places I’ve been in Lagos. The food here is awful, I tried many different dishes and all were poor quality and not what one would expect for a hotel of this caliber. Arrived at the restaurant takes exponentially long, the servers will ignore you or walk right past. Apparently there was a leak from a pipe in my room and it was going downstairs so they said I needed to switch rooms. The room I was in was bright and had a decent view. The room I was moved to was dark and out the window was no view at all, nothing but a wall to another building. Staff only left one towel in my room, no hand towel either.

2 night stay,"While visiting Lagos we decided to treat ourselves to a relaxing stay at this VI hotel.  Previous reviews gave us comfort as we planned our stay.  Arriving from the airport, we contacted the hotel via email to ask about shuttle service.  12,000n was a great rate and they confirmed via text.  The driver arrived (a little late because he was at the wrong terminal).  That was not a problem.    Covid protocols were in place as we arrived to check in.  We did have a bit of a a problem as we did not have our passports with us.  Luckily we had a copy on our phone and that was accepted.

My driver lost my token for parking and the process to leave the property was too  extreme. The were asking that I provide my car documents and pay a fee even though these things aren’t required at check in. They should air out the rooms more often as well to prevent mold.

Lovely Hotel! 🏨 😍,"Radisson Blu is a well known, reputable hotel brand, so when I had an opportunity to stay here, I have to admit that my expectations were a bit high.  Being that it is one of Lagos's high-end hotels, and not to mention the fact that it is conveniently located on the famous Ozumba Mbadiwe Street, (in Victoria Island), it is sure to be a frequent favorite of 'well-to-do' Lagosians and tourists alike.  As I usually do, I'll divide this review into 'Merits' and 'Demerits', based on my experience.   PROS: Upon entering the premises, you could clearly see that it was a well-maintained property.  Impeccably manicured flowerbeds and lawns highlighted the exterior of Radisson Blu Hotel.  Hans & René, (a fancy ice-cream & dessert shop) is located within the grounds.

Woow Service,"I was unfortunate to have stayed in the hotel the period of the Endsars protest. I was unable to checkout on the 21st of October due to the crisis in the city and the curfew. I extended my stay for two more nights. Despite this, I felt at home and the staffs were very friendly. The food was nice and the newly renovated gym and pool made me felt relaxed. After I checked out, I got a surprising call that evening from the hotel's Front Office Manager who asked to know if I got to my destination very safe. That was customer service at its peak.

A great hospitality experience,It was my first time at the hotel. We arrived early and had thought of paying additional charges for early check-in. I was wrong as the Manager of the front desk was so kind and very professional. He ensured we had a very seamless check-in at no additional cost. We got a room on the third floor overlooking the Lagos Lagoon. A very nice view from our window. Though we did not experience most of the facilities due to the Covid-19 safety measures in place. We saw the on-going room renovation work on the opposite floor. The gym and pool have been newly renovated but not yet in use. We had a good Nigerian meal. It was nice and palatable. I would have preferred the buffet but only a'lacarte services are available at the moment. The staffs are very friendly.

"Average for Lagos, but poor overall","Lagos is one of the most energetic and cosmopolitan cities in west Africa, if not the contingent.  However, it's still catching up to ""western"" standards with regards to hotels and infrastructure.

Upon our late arrival, staff were available to assist us with our luggage and we were able to check in without incident (note, the hotel does not offer rooms with 2 beds, despite what is mentioned on their website).

The location is great....perfect spot for reaching downtown etc.  The rooms...well, I can certainly speak from experience (see below), I moved rooms 4 times and cannot fault any of them.

There was a big stain in the middle of the carpet.  The room and installations more generally are badly in need of an upgrade.

The restaurant was untidy even though they had an hour and a half to closing time. Despite the restaurant having more empty than occupied tables there was no made up tables available apart one right at the entrance. All the rest needed cleaning up.  After going round in circles with no one to help I asked for the manager and a young lady came up so I mentioned that they had at least 15 tables used and not cleared! To my utter amazement she told me they had had a lot of guests!!!

Way below expected Radisson Blu standard,"Fundamental issues at this hotel need to be addressed for its price (I paid  $170/night) and status as Radisson's upscale brand. The ambience is average but the real issue is that basic amenities don't work well. During my 5-day business  stay , the water was discolored sometimes to the point of being muddy in appearance. I had to purchase bottled water in bulk to be safe.Worse still, water was completely  unavailable for more than 6 hours on the day I checked out. The carpet in the hallway and rooms are  dated and stained. Furniture and drapes also need to be replaced to be more modern. The staff do make efforts to keep guests comfortable- shout out to Chima and the concierge team, but this cannot make up for obvious management and preventive maintenance lapses.

Excellent experience 5 stars,"On my brief and hectic business trip I stayed at this property earlier this year in September. Let me tell you that the experience was sublime. The front office and the concierge were quick on their feet they were very helpful as well as they asked me if this was my first visit to Nigeria, which it was. They guided me and told me about the places I could visit. The room was on the second floor and was comfortable. Since it was my first visit they gave me upgraded amenities which was very nice of them. The breakfast offerings at the restaurant were good too. Their one call service is very prompt. The hotel is ideally located on Victoria Island so it's easy to move around. In my honest opinion this is what all travelers need, anticipation of needs, and they were doing everything",September 2019,,,wrote a review Dec 2019,"Lagos, Nigeria",['3 contributions'],50,[]
Average hotel,"The room carpet felt dirty, perhaps it’s the style but it didn’t feel too clean at all. There were various items in the room in need of maintenance, holes in the sheets, broken door to the mini bar, drain cover on the shower and generally not in a great condition. This is a three star at best by the quality of the room. The food was average but the club sandwich was excellent.

Excellent Stay,"I was here for a one day stay. Though there were hassles getting a room owing to the fact that the hotel was fully booked Ms Funmi Adebesin was able to follow up in a professional manner to ensure I got a room.  Though my stay was short I was impressed by the breathtaking view from the Lagoon View room I was lodged in. Alway ask for the Lagoon View room when you stay here. It's worth the experience.   The complimentary breakfast was good. Wide spread and nice, clean environment. Professional service. I was impressed.   A few shortcomings though. The wifi was virtually non-existent and checking in was cumbersome. They need to work on that process to ensure wait time is reduced.

Remains expensive,"Stayed at the Radisson again after the disastrous experience with the Federal Palace wifi (or lack thereof). The Radisson remains a bit expensive in my mind. It’s a good hotel, very secure and conveniently located but the rooms are basic, service isn’t terribly good and the food is average. The waiters and waitresses are particularly slack. The deck overlooking the lagoon is quite nice for a drink in the evening and the gym is decent enough.

Review by Edegware F.O,The hotel is the best I have experienced in Nigeria amongst several top others.

"Decent, no room available when we checked-in","Decent hotel in a good part of Lagos. The reason I give it a 3 star (and want to give it a 2) is because they didn't have a room available when we check in in spite of confirmed bookings. We were 4 of us with 4 different room bookings on a business trip: we reached the hotel around 2330 and were told by the lady at the counter, we have 3 rooms, take it or can move the 4th person to another hotel. Almost a fait accompli at that time of the night. Two of us had to share. We were told that it is due a wing of the hotel under maintenance but I think that was all made up for being overbooked.  Room was okay, pretty large. Washroom is huge. Has a shower and tub separately.  Restaurant: had breakfast. Large selection. And a pleasant surprise the coffee machine was a Techniworm",October 2019,,,wrote a review Nov 2019,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['211 contributions', '113 helpful votes']",30,[]

I arrived the hotel early cause of my flight timing, the guy at the desk refuse to check me in that I should wait till 3pm for the check in time but if I want early check in I will need to pay a half day.... that’s crazy and annoying after booking for 8days, but thanks to Chikodi who instruct the guy to allow me to check in early without no additional payment.

Needs an upgrade,"In general the bedrooms need an upgrade, stains on bedcovers and sheets, dirty windows etc. Check in desk only ever seemed to have 1 staff member trained to work on the system. No dedicated hotel cars and drivers, outsourced to a third party, therefore both times the driver was late and cars dirty and not the ‘suv’ as paid for. Very friendly staff and food quite good but overall the stay not worth the price paid.",July 2019,,,wrote a review Jul 2019,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",30,[]

Unbelievably bad,"Ok, I will start with the positives: the staff was very nice. Absolutely every single person was nice and helpful and tried their best. And I am demanding... BUT there is nothing they can do with bad infrastructure. The facilities are OLD. The bar/ restaurant area is ok, the rooms are dreadful. I got the ‘business class’ highest category room, it was worst than a 3 $30 motel in the US. The smell is horrible. Everything smells: the AC smells of mold, the bathroom smells of (well) bathroom, the gym smell of sweat and the half of the gym equipment does not work. Also, the business lounge has no drinks except for coffee and tea and the snacks are so limited they disappear after 5 minutes.

Good but should be better,I was initially checked into a terrible smoking room that stank with burns on the floor and stains of the tables and bed. The only reason I’m giving 3 stars is because the staff were very friendly and quickly resolved this. The hotel overall is quite nice with a good waterfront terrace.

Good,"I expected more from a name like Radisson, and it can definitely be better. The hotel is very costly and the francise must always try to give guests more than to earn more.

Only concern is that all International cards are charged in $USD rather than Naira. Not being American, I get to pay exchange fee twice : a rip-off. First, the hotel charge me in USD at a rate higher than the posted rate ( hotel gets his cut here), and then my bank charged my fees to change back to my own currency.

When I finally got to the hotel I was rudely informed that I couldn’t get into my room because the card holder was different from my name, I understood because of fraud so I quickly asked my friend to transfer the money to card ac so I can pay...there was no compensation for this wait and they made it feel like it was my fault.  Finally got into the room, the corridor had a foul smell, the rug in the room was worn out and stained, that was when I realized i should have chosen another hotel but it was too late because my friends card would be debited if I had cancel.

"Dirty, overpriced and run down","We stayed at this hotel from Feb 27th - March 5th. Check-In was very slow, paid with cash and they wouldn't accept USD bills dated 2009. (Very inconvenient- they should state this on their website) We finally got our room and it was on 1st floor. Sheets were dirty (hairs in the bed, stained sheets), the bathroom sink was leaking on bathroom floor (lucky no one slipped and fell). I called down to front desk and they moved us to a room on the second floor. This room was still run down and sheets were stained, towels were no longer white. They were all grey, so they should either replace or wash with bleach. So glad I packed my own towels etc. Went to breakfast the next morning at the restaurant in the hotel.

Business stay at Radison,"The hotel has fairly good security and friendly personnel at the reception area.

Decent well intended hotel,"My first ever visit to Nigeria. Had my apprehensions prior to arrival, based on inputs and what i had heard from colleagues. Smooth exit from the airport and eventless arrival into the Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel.  Front desk was eager to assist and complete my check in process. Murphys Law exists. Things do go wrong. my credit card refused to work. And finally i had to make a cash down payment as deposit. Had the problem subsequently sorted out in the afternoon.   The rooms are spacious and have decent facilities. Power cuts and black outs (even for a few moments) happens all the time. Strangely this is the norm across the city of Lagos. decent wifi connection. Comfortable beds and pillows. The bathroom could have some rethink. there is no health faucet in the toilet.

Excellent Service,"A centrally located hotel in Lagos which has an abundance of friendly staff employed to take care of the guests. Vivian, Abel and Annie are a few names that come to mind instantly, they always had a smile on their face and made breakfast memorable each day i went into that space.  The bars are nice and to make things interesting we have a mobile bar that serves excellent cocktails, my favorite is the Coconut ones they serve.   The hotel room was decent, clean and comfortable beds with the usual TV, facilities, toiletries and bottled water daily. I enjoyed my short stay thoroughly and would recommend for either business or a relaxing break.",April 2018,,,wrote a review May 2018,"Los Angeles, California",['1 contribution'],50,[]

Not the place for chicken suya!,"Quite an interesting Sunday evening!  We took ice cream at Hans and Rene, then decided to have snacks and drinks in the hotel. A truly unpleasant experience! We ordered chicken suya. It arrived cold. They returned it, probably having microwaved it as the plate was very hot (almost dropped it). It seemed the chicken has been doused in some sort of jerk seasoning and black pepper. Just awful! We complained to the manager that this was inedible and that we wouldn’t pay for it. The burgers we ordered were okish, and the drinks (can’t go wrong) fine. My husband’s fruit salad never arrived, even after reminding them 30 mins later. The manager said he wouldn’t refund us 4,500 naira (about £9) and offered us stewed chicken as take away, which was a pretty ridiculous offer to a customer,",April 2018,,,wrote a review Apr 2018,"London, United Kingdom","['8 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",20,[]

Our rooms was very clean with a lovely view of the lagoon. There was constant hot water and the room was cleaned to a good standard. Also very useful to have the use of the kettle and fridge. The back up generator started quickly when required.  The gym is has the minimum required to do a complete workout with cardio, machine and free weights. Will be even better when the steam room is fixed. The pool are is clean and a great view to the lagoon.

"Quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, anywhere in the world.","I stayed in this hotel for 11 days, with my colleagues and I choosing it for its location near to offices we were visiting. And its a Radisson Blu, so you can't go wrong, can you? Oh yes.  My room was non-smoking, but with the obvious underlying scent of cigarette smoke below the cloying air freshener on arrival. This would explain the various burn marks on the furniture as well.  That's OK, I can look past that, as long as the room is clean and comfortable... Well, part of the room the carpet looked as if someone had been murdered there, and they hadn't been 100% successful in cleaning it up. One of my colleagues had some ""foreign substance"" lodged on the wall next to his WC. Next day it hadn't been cleaned.

Space for your eyes after a weary day in Lagos,"After the trafic and the hustle in the streets of Lagos, you come back to a clean room, welcoming staff but most of all, the greatest view to calm you down and put a smile back to your face.  You shouldn't expect much of trade craft but you don't need it as it is compensated by by the willingness of the staff to help you any way they can.  I took it when easy when they had to come back to give me my room towels and found a don't disturb sign that they called me instead, woke me up, to tell me that they needed to give me the towels but can't because if the sign.

Go-to business hotel,"Ive stayed in a few places on VI and this as become my current go to (over Eko, four points, federal palace and intercontinental). I stay here every few months on business and its always consistently good. From a work point of view it’s well located on VI for most places and the broadband is decent enough and works on all devices. No silly log in daily to get a code or anything.  No iron or ironing board in the room but they’ll always bring you one.  Service is exemplary with everyone at the hotel friendly, helpful and approachable.  Points off only for food order can be slow (though improved), TVs in the standard rooms are bit outdated now and don’t have HDMI input and gym small.

She is always out on the floor greeting guests and putting a face on hotel operations. The staff are all Connected, and committed.

Avoid during peak seasons,Arrived on Christmas day and had to wait over 2 hours for a room we had booked in August. It appeared as if the hotel was overwhelmed by being fully booked. The housekeeping was below par. Got a towel with strands of hair on two occasions. Toilet bowl and sink had stains. Water from the shower was lukewarm at night and early in the morning. I really expected much more attention to detail from such a beautiful and pricey (~$300 a night) hotel. I would have given an even lower rating if not for the front desk staff and security staff who were really pleasant and helpful.

Buffet cuisine wasn't special. It was very pricy and not sumptuous. I'll recommend they look into it.  Pros: Receptionist was very friendly, courteous and professional. The lady with the name tag ""Sheila"" was soo chatty and helpful. I'll recommend they give her a raise.  Room:   We stayed at the Business Class suit. Pricy but worth it.

"Clearly positioned as a ""social spot"" and hangout with the needs of the actual in house guests a low priority","Where do i start .... Was booked for a potentially long business stay - 6 weeks.  First observation - nasty, damp, fetid corridors leading to rooms. Opened the door to a musty, smelly room with poor lighting with quite a few bulbs not working ( maybe to hide the many little mysterious stains on the carpet, upholstery and bed covers). Tried to open windows to air the room and for some fresh air. Windows don't open unless by special request! Had to wait 45 mins for housekeeping to locate the special window opening tool and send someone up. Bathroom was in need of a thorough scrub. The room was too dark, dank and depressing to work in so headed to the executive lounge to work . Even worse . Looked dusty, dark and abandoned with same horrid damp smell .

The furniture in the hotel lounge and rooms are all stained and worn out. The carpets in the halls are also stained and in teh non-smoking hall, you can still smell smoke. It seems the hotel's management has not invested anything into maintenance and it shows. Also the room service is absolutely horrible.

Absolutely TERRIBLE,"Received the most DISGUSTING and inept service at this hotel, at the hands of one of the security guards, whose name I believe to be Zhinifa (who tried to cover his name tag, when I asked to file a report), Saliu (bar man) and a light skinned porter in a black suit. When asked for the GM, we were told they do not have one. Only to discover via LinkedIn that they do indeed have a GM, Kevin Kamau, who they refused to contact in order to file this report. Shoddy, rude, insanely disrespectful service to paying clients. You couldn’t pay me to return. Someone needs to conduct a hospitality training course at this hotel.

Its really a perfect place to relax, have a drink, and take in good weather (when the weather is good in Lagos).

I have seen the construction of the hotel long time ago.

And you know, the Radisson Blu met all of these requirements.  Most important, I remember the service -- everyone was smiling, willing to help, had answers, provided direction and actually reached out to guests to ask if they needed anything.  Excellent service.  We did a meeting as well at the hotel and all the people, including the security, were consistent in asking if our needs had been met and if there were anything else we required.

"Average Hotel, High Price.","I stayed at the Radisonn on business, this is a very secure hotel I guess this is the reason my company offers no other hotels as an option. On arrival cars are searched at closed gates before allowing to proceed into the hotel complex. There is further guest/visitor search at the hotel door, this for me made it a safe place to stay in Lagos. Outside of the excellent security, the hotel is average at best. My room was large (get a Lagoon facing room for a good view) with plenty of storage, but it was very dated in  appearance, the bathroom decoration could have done with a refurb. the towels were old and stained.

Excellent stay,"I stayed at the property for over two months and the staff were incredible. Thanks to Chizoba from reservations and a special thanks to Chima from the front desk. She was the most friendliest and kind soul and made my stay much more comfortable. She is a gem and I hope that radisson realizes it! The hotel is located centrally in VI close to the embassies and business area, with views of the lagoon. Excellent security which made me feel really safe, and a relaxed outdoor bar area. The breakfast wasn't all that nice, but the staff were very friendly. The rooms are very comfortable, apart from the fact that the carpets and upholstery are terribly dirty.

Tired and not the usual Radisson standard,I travelled to Lagos for work recently and stayed in the Radisson. This is a secure hotel and the best option it seems on the island.

Dissapointed in this Raddison Blu.,"I stayed at the Raddison Blu in Achorage Lagos twice in 2017 and both times I had to change rooms due to a problem with the basin and shower respectively.   The kettle in both my rooms on my recent trip didn't work. A colleague who joined me also had to change rooms because of air conditioning not working.   During both stays I had to phone reception 3 or more times as they forgot to send someone to resolve issues like to remove the previous guest's used tooth brushes left behind, not having towels and to get an in-room dining menu.

Quality hotel but with some limitations,"I've stayed here on two occasions this year.  The hotel is convenient for Victoria Island businesses and is located by the creek, which adds character to it compared to many in Lagos.  The terrace bar is excellent and provides good quality bar food as well as live music most evenings, which makes it an ideal place to relax after a day's work.  Once the humidity gets too much, there is also a good bar inside (though a little dark and characterless).  The rooms are good with all the facilities you'd expect, but often the finishing touches are not quite there.  My net curtains looked like they'd been dragged through a hedge.

Overpriced and shabby,"I booked this hotel because of the Radisson brand name, and boy was it a disappointment!   The good things - centrally located in Victoria Island, spacious room and very good WiFi.   But that was the good stuff. Everything else was awful. The hotel is poorly maintained - the wall mounted mirror fell off one day. Hot water in the bathroom is a matter of luck - varied between ""better than lukewarm"" and ""cool"" - but was never hot. Staff are not responsive - they say something will be done in 30 mins and then nothing happens until you follow up. Out of 5 days, housekeeping didn't bother replacing coffee sachets on 3 days!

Due to these issues I changed rooms to a standard room but when I arrived after work, my bag was not there as promised, nor were there any towels in the room at all (and all I wanted was to shower).

Besides this, you are asked 50% of the price of the room (please make the calculation) for an early check in (2 hours!!!).

My worst stay in Lagos,"Was my first time at this hotel, visiting early in Feb 2017. It is easy to be critical of the service of hotels in Lagos, especially looking at they prices they charge. But this stands out as my worst hotel experience of any business trip over the past four years. This is why: 1) Arrived on the Monday evening with several colleagues, to find that they had booked me into a smoking room. It is a clear preference with our corporate travel agent (and I travel often), yet the hotel proceeded to blame this on the travel agent and refused to take any responsibility.  2) They claimed the hotel was full and could not move me until the next day. The smell of smoke in the room was disgusting. 3) They finally managed to move me the next day (of course I still had to pay for the stinking",February 2017,,,wrote a review Apr 2017,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['10 contributions', '9 helpful votes']",20,[]

@Radisson Blue Lagos,A let down. Radison Blue was always a prestigious name with swell hotels. This hotel is however old and past its glory days. Everything is clean and work with average service. The carpet runner in the hallway past my room is old and worn at places and it is a long time since I have seen a carpet with so many stains from end to end. It is OK for short stays however is not on my bucket list to spend a long period or holiday.,January 2017,,,wrote a review Feb 2017,"Pretoria, South Africa","['112 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",30,[]
Excellent Experience!,"Radisson Blu experience was a delightful and very memorable one both times I visited.   First was a 2 night stay which was awesome. The room was very neat, bathroom lovely and the breakfast buffet was simply great.   The second visit was even more memorable as I chose the Surface Bar as the location to propose to my fiancé on Dec 24 2016, Christmas eve. The experience was phenomenal.

Nigerians generally give good service so no worries there and this hotel has an outside deck onto water with a bar some live music occasionally with restaurant in or outside. Room was clean although some exposed wiring and water pressure quite low but I liked this hotel and will definitely make it my preferred choice, it's the right side of the bridge to get in to see business clients without hours of traffic so if you travel to VI on business probably a much better choice than the in my impression over rated Southern Sun.",October 2016,,,wrote a review Oct 2016,"London, United Kingdom","['23 contributions', '54 helpful votes']",40,[]

A Refreshing Change in Lagos,"I love Lagos ... Bustling and brimming with energy and life ... But in general the service / hospitality sector in Lagos needs to work on actually living up to the word 'service'.   So I was really pleasantly surprised with the great service and hospitality I got at Radisson Blu. My first time to stay there ... I usually stay at another 5 star hotel (which I won't name or shame here!), but wanted S change. And my secretary booked me at the Radisson Blu.   Rooms are acceptable quality ... Clean and spacious and tidy and functional. But it's the service I am raving about. In a 3 day stay, I think I had 6 hotel staff ask me ""how is your stay? Any feedback for us?"" ... And they had a pen and paper to note down my feedback!  So they take the feedback seriously.

2 Month Straight Stay in Lagos at Radisson Blu,"As part of a 2 month straight work assignment, many of my colleagues recommended the Radisson Blu in Lagos, which turned out to be a great experience. Each day, staff members greeted me with enthusiasm and were always professional even after getting to know me. Furthermore, each morning I received the paper  at my door and when I didn't, the staff members were sure to get it to me before I left for the day.   Anytime I had an issue (which wasn't often), staff members promptly addressed it or communicated that the issue would be resolved. Moreover, I would get periodic phone calls from management to check on the service, my room, and overall stay.

Very disappointing,"I have many local friends in Lagos who all swear to me that this is the best hotel in the city. The good things about this hotel is that the staff are overall very helpful and polite, there is a nice outdoor seating area and the location is very convenient for business travelers. However,  that is where the joy ends.  I cannot describe how badly the hallway as well as the rooms stank. Initially, I had convince myself that this was because of mosquito repellent being used for our convenience. However, I was later told that this hotel has had drainage issues historically and that I couldn't very well be the smell pertaining to those issues.

Watching the stars across the Lagoon!,"Sitting on the View Bar beside the pool and watching the night sky, I felt the cold breeze whisper in my ears.

Then, I gazed at the hitherto dark sky only to find stars are out. Something told me they have come to dance to the music but I could be wrong.

Good hotel in Lagos,"Radisson BLU is a very good hotel on Victoria Island in Lagos with good service, helpful staff and a menu with a mix of Western and Nigerian style cooking.

I must confess that I had great expectations of the hotel and even changed my accomodations from another were I was previously booked to Radisson as my colleagues pressed me to do so. Overall I will say my expectations were met up to about 80% and this is largely due to the wonderful couteous staffs they have. from the gate to checkin and calls to complain they are very responsive. However, i booked the standard room but only to discover some minor maintenance issues. I reported some but refused to call further for complaints.

The hotel has ample parking space and is situated at the waterfront. The hotel is modern and well designed. It feautures a restaurant (a la carte and buffet) with a varied range of food. The buffet feautures fine examples if the Nigerian kitchen (which can be spicy). Staff is very friendly, but if you order a la carte, it can take a while before dinner is actually served. Outside is a bar, directly at the waterfront. It is relaxed to sit outside an enjoy drinks or choose from the bar menu (which is the same as the a la cartr restaurant).

I found the service very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast is superb: local and global choices and plenty of it too. And the wifi is very fast, which makes a big difference if you're here on business. Pool and bar service a bit slower and in-room dining not up to par, but otherwise the place makes for a very comfortable stay.",April 2016,,,wrote a review Apr 2016,SF,"['684 contributions', '188 helpful votes']",40,[]

Time out of space...by the scenic lagoon.,"So, I went there with my best friend to review a room which she wanted to book for a product launch. I am always going on and on about service. For me, that is what it is all about...get service right and everything else can be forgiven! On arrival the reception area was bright and interesting, the smiles on the faces of the reception desk officers was a delight (this is 6pm...the time when a dicey day begins to wear upon one's temperament...so genuineness matters). However, I am not surprised, Nigerians do get that right most and generally. Then the lady comes to show us the room, takes on all our criticisms, comments and suggestions...and immediately calls the attention of maintenance to an issue we'd spotted! That told me she was serious about what we had to say (applause).",April 2016,,,wrote a review Apr 2016,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","['37 contributions', '20 helpful votes']",40,[]

Hospitality at its best.,"This hotel had completely changed my views on Nigerian hospitality. From the moment I walked and was attended by the very lovely lady Vivian (hope I got the name right) that set the pace for a very lovely and wonderful stay. I have stayed in a few hotels in Nigeria when I visit and I usually complain about the hospitality service which in my opinion lacks in a lot of establishments in Nigeria, but my brother recommended Radisson which is usually his choice of stay. All I can say is, every single staff was incredible and they have managed to make the hotel a 5* facility.  Rooms are beautiful, clean, beds are comfortable, Friday night entertainment was fantastic.  Only criticism I have, is the breakfast.

Service was poor with waiters in the bar areas inattentive and drinks warm. The Buffet Breakfast and Dinner in the restaurant was extremely poor and a-la-carte service disappointing as they forgot my orders twice.

You have opportunity to see beautiful city of Lagos night sceen due to its location. Life band performance at the bar side is also awesome, the singers sings well and the quality of sound produced by the musical equipment is also pleasant to hearing.   Radinson staff are very polite and neat.  Receptionist are very okay in welcoming the visitors.  The rooms are neat and tidy.  Quality of foods and beverages are also fantastic.  In-fact, you can sleep with your two eyes closed due to the security level in Radinson blu hotel. access to the rooms and corridors are well controlled and all the lodgers have their privacy.

Great Place to Stay on VI,The peace and tranquility inside the clean rooms allows one to truly enjoy personal privacy. The view of the lagoon is refreshing. The front office staff are warm and helpful. I was a little surprised though that the Club Carlson Card does not work in certain restaurants.

Really nice (and secure) hotel,"The Radisson Blu hotel in Lagos has much to offer.  Let me count the ways: 1) rooms are very nice; Wifi is good; lobby area is spacious and modern; the restaurant provides really good buffet meals; the staff are friendly, attentive and efficient; the pool area is clean and inviting; the view from the hotel across the lagoon is very pleasant; the workout room is well equipped and maintained.  However, the best thing I observed was the soldier with the machine gun who was patrolling the area around the hotel.  The weekend I spent at the Lagos Radisson Blu was the same weekend that the Radisson Blu in Bamako, Mali was attacked by terrorists.  Or perhaps it was workplace violence as some in the US would lead you to believe.  Perhaps the attack in Mali was in response to bad waiter",November 2015,,,wrote a review Dec 2015,"Galveston Island, Texas","['108 contributions', '26 helpful votes']",50,[]

Comfort in Lagos,"The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable, hot water and shower pressure is always available. Excellent for meeting with business guests in a relaxed environment or in a formal business lounge. The gym is great and the pool is long for swimming laps. on the negative side the waiter service is a bit slow, so get your first and second drinks and meal ordered right in the beginning. The best time to swim is just after sunset as not only is it cool but the airflow is offshore so you don't breath in fumes.",November 2015,,,wrote a review Nov 2015,"Belfast, United Kingdom","['62 contributions', '16 helpful votes']",40,[]

Boutique hotel that is safe and beautiful,"This hotel is on the water's edge at the north of Victoria Island. It's a beautifully decorated boutique hotel with friendly and welcoming staff. The view over the water from the bar and restaurant is very nice.  I got the impression that the security at this hotel is good - there are many security guards at the entrances to the hotel and access to the corridors leading to the rooms is controlled by access cards.   My room was well appointed and clean - the towels and pillows smelled lovely! The only annoying this about my room was the light above my bed that I couldn't figure how to turn off.   This hotel is definitely not cheap, but it offers you safe, luxurious accommodation, so I'll definitely use it again when I'm in Lagos.",October 2015,,,wrote a review Nov 2015,"Conegliano, Italy","['42 contributions', '9 helpful votes']",50,[]
Nice bar and ice cream shop.,"Radisson Blu re-opened recently after a long shut down for renovations and service improvements. The decor remains lovely and the outdoor bar has an amazing view of the lagoon which never ceases to please me. What i noticed in my recent visits is that the staff are now friendlier and more service oriented which made for a more pleasant experience. I also visited the Hand & Rene ice cream place for a taste of the zobo and forest fruits ice cream flavours that i'd read about on a blog and it was pretty nice. I've stayed in their rooms, visited the Spa and the ice cream shop.

Service is 'off' - disappointing.,"When you walk into this hotel, it's what you'd expect from a Radisson, lovely decor, room is good,and the staff are genuinely helpful. It also has a lovely outside riverside terrace.  But there are just too many things that are 'off' - on their own, nothing major, but when you put them together, it's irritating - on arrival, the wifi room login didn't work, so went to reception to get a voucher instead, then couldn't get back into my room because the key pad had stopped working, had to wait for maintenance (this all happening at 5 in the morning!), arrived at breakfast just after 9, none of the tables were set up so had to scramble around to get cutlery, serviettes, etc, next morning still couldn't logon to wifi, try to phone reception, phone next to bed didn't work, etc.",October 2015,,,wrote a review Nov 2015,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['17 contributions', '9 helpful votes']",20,[]

The dining options were limited - one main restaurant and an outside bar/light fare restaurant.

Thrown out of the hotel due to a labour dispute,"The first couple of days of my stay went smoothly, but half way through all the guests received letters on Saturday asking them to vacate the hotel immediately.  The management had been having issues with the staff over pay and working conditions and chose to shut up shop rather than seek a negotiated solution.  Perhaps this is not the whole story but all I can say is that the management were nowhere to be seen when we were forced to check out, luckily I had local assistance to switch to the Intercontinental - which incidentally was cheaper too.

Clean and safe place to stay,This hotel offers a nice location by the river. I booked a basic room but as a member I got an upgrade to room with a river view. The room was relatively big and it was always clean. They give you two 0.5 liter water bottles per day. It is expensive but so are corresponding hotels in Lagos. This goes also for the food which was bit pricy. The service was good even though one employee tried to over charge me for scanning a document. The hotel has a pretty nice gym with lot of equipment.

Disappointing experience,Stayed in the Radisson for a night - and what a disappointing night it was. After collecting our room keys and went up to the rooms we opened the door to find a very unpleasant smell - akin to that of urine and wet carpet. Not a good start.

After we got the room change we went back up and the air conditioning was not working properly. At this point we figured we would manage seeing as the room didn't stink.  There were more shenanigans to come however. We ordered some food at about 2am (they got our order wrong and then brought up some strange tasting meat masquerading as Suya).

"Pretty damn good, for Nigeria!","Reviewing this hotel in the context of other hotels in Lagos (and elsewhere in Africa) it is very good. Clean, comfortable and plenty of friendly, helpful staff. The gym looked good (although I only checked it out and didn't use it due to EVD concerns during my visit).   Couple of things stopped me giving this place a higher rating. 1. Rooms smell just a tad damp due to the almost open plan nature of the bathroom, and 2. If you don't want to eat at the buffet the menus at the bars are very limited. 3. There's always an issue trying to connect to the internet with my iPhone.

"Very Good, in Lagos Standard.","Quite surprisingly, once I got inside the hotel, I forgot where I was.  Only big reminder for me that I was in Lagos was when I ran water in washroom sink.  Just like any other hotels in Lagos, brownish water is the standard.  Otherwise, room was clean, linen was good, amenity was well replenished, and the stay itself was pleasant.  Internet was not so bad, but not so stable either as power was cut frequently.  But this, you can't complain while in Nigeria.  Breakfast was plenty, and I've really enjoyed some local spicy salad-like vegetables.  It was really good.  (I didn't bother asking what it was called).  Overall, I can recommend this hotel to anybody who's visiting Lagos, and I'm quite sure it would be a better option than other accommodations around.",November 2013,,,wrote a review Oct 2014,"Kawasaki, Japan","['53 contributions', '24 helpful votes']",40,[]

While I requested if I could get a room overlooking the water I was given a smoking room that was not sound proof to the generator resulting in bad nights sleep every night.

At breakfast, the ""cleaning"" of the table from the people who ate before us consisted of casually wiping off the crumbs with a used cloth napkin and moving the silverware from the nearby seat to replace the used seat. Cleaning complete!  The breakfast on offer was far below par - stale bread, unappetizing fruit and cold cut selection, and bitter coffee.

Solid choice,Stayed in the Radisson on my first trip to Nigeria and thus little to compare it to.   This is a hotel in the middle of one of the busiest cities in the world. There are 17m people in Lagos and thus very important to make sure your hotel is well placed as traffic is a nightmare.  It can take 3 hours to go from the hotel to the airport and it is 40 km away. If your business is in Victoria Island then good choice.  Rooms are decent size and well appointed. All amenities amid good internet connectivity. Nothing to complain about . Try and get a room overlooking the river and should upgrade you if you ask.  Breakfast is good and well presented. Staff are attentive and polite  Gym is OK but nothing special.

Great for short business trips to Lagos,"As with most hotels in Lagos, this is very expensive so don't have expectations of getting what you pay for comparing prices with say Europe or the US. But I guess if you're in Lagos you're probably on business and the hotel is a business expense... if you're looking for value probably look elsewhere. Rating this hotel is therefore relative to other hotels in Lagos!  The hotel is well run, with slick check-in. The a/c in the lobby is under spec'd which means that it's noisy and you have to talk loud over it to be heard, but it looks nice though!  The rooms are a good size, clean enough and the bathroom layout is even a little trendy. The rooms are already starting to smell damp though which I guess is inevitable in Nigeria.

I saw officials from the hospital only the first couple of days and they have abandoned me here to my fate. I have been in hospital ever since and nobody has bothered to confirm if things got worse or if I have lost my leg.

Pleasant stay with some hickups,"Stayed for 6 nights in Lagoon view room, at 390USD incl. BF.  Lagos in general very expensive, and the value at extreme low level comparing to e.g. Asia (or even  Europe). Checkin fast and friendly. Nice location on VI, next to Lagoon. Rooms nice, but with some issues:  Safe didn't work and took 4 hours to get a staff to come look at the problem. Internet extremely unstable. Shower drain and cubicle poorly designed - lots of water all over the floor after showering. Light in bathroom broke - took 36hrs before they came to replace the bulb.  Breakfast okay. Bad ""burnt"" coffee, but the food spread fine. Very nice pool. Gym small, but good quality with some weight machines and cardio machines.

Great hotel,"I always stay here when I'm in town on business - it's a lovely hotel.  Staff are polite and courteous (apart from the front desk staff who are very curt and dismissive at times), and the rooms on the 3rd floor overlooking the Lagoon are superb.  Security is good, and I always feel safe.  My only gripe is with the choice of food on the menu - where are the local dishes? Chips, burgers, sandwiches and chicken wings I can get anywhere, so more local fare is needed, and imagination! That said, the buffet breakfast is fantastic, and saves the day.  I love the pool, and it has to be seen and experienced. It almost looks as if it continues into the lagoon when you're lounging on the sun beds! Brilliant design.  Will certainly stay again on my next trip to Lagos.",March 2014,,,wrote a review Apr 2014,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","['29 contributions', '27 helpful votes']",40,[]

"Not bad, but a few issues to report","Stayed at the Radisson Blu for 3 nights in March as part of a business trip to Lagos.  This hotel is one of the US embassy recommended properties and there were obvious governmental and other VIP guests in the hotel during my short stay there.  I had a pleasant stay and thought the rooms, the common areas, restaurant and food were all fine.  However we did have significant issues with wireless internet at one point which makes it a little difficult to do your job when you rely on 100% up-time.  I also wanted to mention that the checkout process left a definitely bad impression with me.

Beautiful grounds but customer service needs improvement!,"I recently stayed at the Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel in Lagos for business for a couple of weeks.   The Pros: The hotel itself, including the location, decor, views, cleanliness and atmosphere are really nice.  The gym is also nice and well-equipped.  The pool, even though I didn't use it, was nice.  As for the concierge, Douglas and Yusuf really stood apart and made my stay very pleasant, as they were helpful and accommodating!  A couple of the View Bar staff were very nice as well (I don't remember their names, though).   The Cons: First, the receptionists need to be trained on proper customer service!  They didn't return phone calls when they said ""I'll call you right back"", and I felt that I was bothering them.

I would however suggest avoiding the food, the menu is very limited, with average quality Western style cuisine and a handful of local specialities that are best avoided if you plan to do anything the following day.

It's the second day now the service is at best intermittent - we had a meeting here at the hotel today and all the presenters had to avoid using internet in their demos.

The views of the lagoon were very nice, although the smell sometimes made sitting outside a tad bit uncomfortable.

Good Business Htel in Lagos,"I have traveled to Lagos since the mid seventies and I have seen the city grow in both size and choice of accommodation. The choice is, now, exsensive although it comes at a price. During my most recent visit I was lucky enough to stay at the Radisson Anchorage on Victoria Island. The hotel is close to the business center of Lagos and close to a few good restaurants and expat bars.  Driving time to and from the airport can vary, greatly, depending on what time you depart. The hotel itself is a modern design and has a number of eateries and bars. The riverside bar is particularly good and they serve a number of different local and import beers. The menu of spirits is quite impressive.

Disappointing Hotel from Radisson Blu,"I guess this is a kind of hotel that brings the Radisson Blu chain to disrepute.  I had organised a meeting for almost 50 people and the service I received was disgusting. All the hotel staff care about is money. The hotel too is only focused on filling the coffers vs. offering service.  The hotels location is great but given the  security concerns and restriction in movement the hotel offers little in terms of extras to kill time. The setting is idyllic just by the water front. Security nice, Rooms are super, especially the water facing ones.   Upon checking in I was given a twin bed room despite the fact I had a request for a double bed.

When you walk down the corridors they have an industrial feel that you would not associate with a high end hotel like the Radisson Blu.  The food at the hotel is really dreadful.

An oases in Lagos,"Rating is much about expectations, I came to Lagos and had to stay one night in a guest house that wasn't that nice due to unavailability of other hotels. Moving to the Radisson was a blessing. The hotel was actually very good and from an ambience perspective it was very pleasant. It was very relaxing to come back to the hotel after spending a day in the hectic Lagos. The standard is high, the rooms clean and modern.

"Ok hotel, great for socialising not so good to stay","The hotel is lovely to look at, big glass windows make it light however also have the effect of turning the lobby into a bit of a greenhouse/ sauna.

Some rooms seem to have been refurbished, others not at all.  The food is good, especially the snacks on the terrace (calamari are a must have!).  Not a bad hotel but not the best by a long way...

Potential to be a great hotel,"Understand that to be fair, you have to judge this hotel amongst its peers; i.e. other luxury hotels in Lagos, not amongst other hotels of the same brand.   Features of Lagos hotels are:  1. Bad service and extremely slow check in/out 2. Brown/yellow smelly water 3. Credit cards that get mysteriously declined  All of this is true of the Radisson. The breakfast is average, check in drove us mad, 3 of my 6 colleagues travelling with me had their identical corporate credit cards ""declined"" and nobody seemed much interested.

Order in advance and a driver will meet you at the airport. Do not be stressed he's if you don't see him immediate, he's waiting outside. A lot of the drivers are in one way or another able to get into the arrival area of the airport. Meaning before immigration and passport control.)  Also check and double check if you order return transportation. Things seems easily forgotten.   The front desk have some work to do. This took too long.

Best so far in Lagos,"I stay regularly in Lagos.  Complaints abound about the costs - if you have to visit, it is expensive but then so is everywhere else in Lagos! BUT - this is the best hotel I have stayed in in the city! Rooms are good, especially if you have a lagoon view, contain everything you would normally expect of a western hotel. The bathrooms, showers and toilets are more than adequate.  Wifi is good throughout the hotel. The food is very good with a choice from full dinner to bar snacks served outside.

"New and beautiful, but bad service and brown water","After 1 week at Radisson my team did a “hotel crawl” to check out the other top hotels from Tripadvisor. We had some incidents with ignorant staff, brown water in the shower, frequent power failures and a smell of sewer outside. We ended up moving to Four Points.   It turns out that even though rooms, food and beverages are extremely overpriced at Radisson, it is the same price level everywhere, so it is still the most liveable hotel in Lagos.   Rooms are new and beautiful, the common area and pool terrace is lively and full of people. Safety is good and the breakfast buffet is reasonable.

Usual fare probably not as wide a selection as other Radisson's I have breakfasted in but still very good , nicely cooked mixed omelette, cereals, fruit etc etc and speciality coffees at no extra cost. Breakfast was about N5000 (£20) which is Ok for Lagos. Best to eat indoors as there is an odour from the lagoon in the breakfast seating area outdoors.  Afterwards went out for a further cappuccino on the outdoor terrace which was comfortable and elegant overlooking the lagoon.

Sitting on the outside deck of the hotel after a long day's work is a great way to unwind, although the occasional smell of sewage (or more correctly, refuse floating in the water) did take the edge of this.

All basic services are in place inc. standard free wireless like in all Radisson hotels, small buff breakfast, nicely equipped gym and outdoor swimming pool.

There's never an ""I'll be right with you"". The staff seem to be unable to prioritize or multitask. Further, they often argue with each other, right in front of customers. Also, the man who was checking me in actually stepped away from the desk to chat / flirt with some good looking female patrons -- amazing!

Great night sleep!,Had a very pleasant stay at the Radisson Blu on my visit to Lagos.  The rooms are very nice but the highlight are the great beds! Made for a great night's sleep. The morning breakfast is also very generous and I tried not to miss it.  Make sure to request a room with a Lagoon view as the noise coming from the very busy main road can be at times unbearable. Honking horns seems to be a national pastime in Nigeria.  Unfortunately the hotel's road is a main thoroughfare leading out of Victoria Island and it can quite congested during rush hour. This can mean some patience in getting back to your hotel between 5pm and 7pm.  The outdoor terrace is a great place to meet for after work drinks or to conduct meetings.

Nice Hotel but a few Operational Hiccups,"Stayed at the Radisson for 2 nights from the 31st December 2011 to the 2nd February 2012.

On checking in we were told there were no double bed rooms available and even suggested the kids could sleep on the floor with a duvet. I gave them a piece of my mind about that and it seemed to wake them up. After a 2 hour wait, I was upgraded to a lagoon facing executive double room and was asked to pay half the price on my intial bill for the entire stay. Not bad for compensation I must say.
