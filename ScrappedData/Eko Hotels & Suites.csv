Deterioration of service and quality,"For the past 5 years ive always stayed at the Eko main hotel. Ive noticed the deterioration of services and quality. More and more items are not available on the menus, even a simple pina colada from crossroads restaurant could not be made due to lack of ingredients. The room service menu is even worse- more than 50% of items are not available. Ive requested an iron to my room and had to wait 45 min before it arrived. Food is overpriced and quality greatly reduced- since Eko caters more and more for the masses it seems. This is no longer an exclusive hotel like before. Upon checkout I requested assistance with my luggage and decided to carry the suitcases myself after waiting for more than 35 minutes. My dissapointment has increased after each visit.",September 2023,Traveled on business,"Rooms are okay yet clean. Bathrooms needs refurbishment.

Congress center more than a hotel,"This place is more a congress center than just  a hotel. It includes seminar rooms, huge conference rooms, hotel rooms and suites. Plus some other places under the same brand names, outside the main complex. We tried only a few of these facilities, when not at full capacity.  The architecture of the place seems designed to make it a versatile place. However, the result is a maze, that can turn quickly into a mess when crowded.

Drunk security guard assaulted my husband,"My husband and I booked Eko Hotel in November. We entered from the pedestrian gate after a walk and was demanded to provide ID to enter the grounds. For safety reasons we refused and called front desk. The front desk advised this was not protocol and this security was not acting in accordance with policy. Regardless, he refused to allow us in and proceeded to physically attack my husband after we ignored him and continued to the hotel. It was very clear he was angry and drunk while on duty. Another security said he was his supervisor and asked us not to report him. We complained to the front desk about the assault and they asked to call us back to discuss it and never did.

Eko Hotel what’s happening?,"I’ve stayed here so many times before and it’s always been a pleasure able experience. I organise oil and gas events and organise the team to stay here. This trip however was the worst I’ve had at the the Eko. None of the meals were available , pepper soup, no chicken , no meat just fish. Meals took ages to come. When the drinks arrived they were harassing me to pay now and saying signing to the room isn’t possible. After swimming I’m on the seats and they are telling me to leave because they have ‘closed’ meanwhile the Europeans are not being harassed like me.

Adequate enough,"This is the 4th time I stayed at the hotel as an adult. I remember coming here with my family as a kid and for some reason, the hotel still has a very good reputation but I think it’s more about the reputation from the old days. It’s lost a lot of its ‘magical’ touches and I usually book here because of a show or wedding happening at the hotel. This time, I booked a superior room facing the Atlantic however I got only a partial view of the Atlantic but the view of the pool was very nice. The room was outdated with old furniture but bed was comfortable nonetheless. Balcony and bathroom are also old fashioned. Bathroom also needs more lighting.

Very disappointed,"We paid 50% of room rate to check in early after a long flight- this hotel was highly recommended by a family member.  We were told only smoking room available which we refused, we were then given a standard room when we paid for Atlantic superior, so had to wait 30 mins to be moved.   The new room had a view of a river and was small and tired- air conditioning was faulty, safe was faulty, one of the showers didn’t work.   The toilet water was running all night which kept us awake as well as no soundproofing what so ever in the rooms so could hear everything.

Understand there are multiple hotels in the complex before booking,"I booked here and chose what I thought was the cheapest room. I had seen pictures on TripAdvisor and everything looked ok, so I assumed the rate was due to the fact that I wasn't choosing a suite. What I didn't know is that there are I believe 3 Eko hotels on the property. They are of differing quality. The TripAdvisor pictures are for all the hotels, so if you are looking at a picture of a nice room, that's probably at the nicer, more expensive hotel. Be aware of which hotel you are booking. I ended up staying at the cheapest. It was ok for Africa, but would not be so good elsewhere. I did have some drinks in the main hotel and it looked very nice.

A Lagos hotel you'd actaully look forward to staying in,"I can't quite believe I'm giving a Lagos hotel five out of five, without even adding 'this is Nigeria'.  Looking for an alternative after staying at the Four Points and Radisson Blu for years, Eko Hotel popped up? Why had I not stayed here before? I think it used to be very pricey, but it's currently less than the Four Points, which has become shabby and dirty and stopped offering smoking rooms, or the Radisson, also getting shabby and which has similarly stopped offering smoking rooms. (You can stay in an ex-smoking room which smells of smoke and has cigarette burns all over the carpets and the desk, but which you aren't allowed to smoke in...)

Eko Signature Suites - Decent Value,"Lagos is notoriously expensive and you need apply a different standard when comparing hotels to other cities – but in relative terms the Eko Signature Suites offer good value. (Not to be confused with the main hotel which is run down!) It was half the price we were quoted by the Radisson Blu and the same as the Federal Palace and this is certainly a better option. The Eko Suites take a little longer to get to than the other two mentioned and traffic can build up a bit on the roundabout but it’s not too serious. Checking in and out is efficient, the rooms are very spacious and they have coffee machines with pods.

The only problem that I had it was with service at the Pub, apparently they were not able to charge the bill to my room and only realised during closing and decided to call directly my room after midnight so that I would go back to the bar and pay.

Good Hotel,I stayed in the Signature Suites for four days. Generally the staff were courteous and respectful. They always had a greeting for you. The facilities worked well most of the time.

Quality sleep guaranteed but the Internet can be improved,"One thing that is certain for any Visitor is quality sleep. The bed in my room gave me a feel that I didn't leave my house. The Sky restaurant and Lagoon restaurant offer variety of food that tantalize the palate. The bathroom now has a walk-in shower and though I miss the bath tub (which is always fun for the kids when they have their bubble bath), the walk-in does it for me. One thing that can be improved on though is the cleaning of the common facilities (Convenience) as the unpleasant smell that assails the nostrils of guests when walking towards the elevator or ATM at the lower level leaves so much to be desired. Also, the internet speed and reliability can be better. Overall though, the location and the experience is good.",June 2019,,,wrote a review Jul 2019,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria","['724 contributions', '26 helpful votes']",40,[]
Eko Suites: Escape from the Din,"I have avoided staying at the Eko Hotel due to their lax access control-I was once accosted  by a music CD hawker in the elevator whilst heading to the Sky Restaurant at the hotel. However, I had to stay there-fortuitously-this time around and was pleasantly surprised when I experienced the serenity of the Eko Suites.  It is secluded, away from the cacophony at the Eko Hotel grounds and has ample parking for own guests. The rooms were spacious and sparingly adorned with wall art;the wifi signal was strong and consistent.   However, the clincher for me was the location: quiet and away from the crowd of hangers-on usually found on the central hotel grounds as various events are held at its convention centre, restaurants and night club.",May 2019,,,wrote a review Jun 2019,"Berlin, Germany","['357 contributions', '28 helpful votes']",40,[]

Then they give you a few, so you have to keep going back to the reception for more. The staff that take your order for room service sound like you’re wasting their time.

Easter Getaway At Eko Suites,"For Easter, close friends and family had a three night getaway from the chaos of Lagos at the Eko Suites, one of the 4 residences run by the Eko Hotel and Suites Brand in Victoria Island Lagos.   Checking in was pleasant and swift, rooms spacious, tidy and well chilled with extra beds for parents staying over with kids.   The rooms provide views of the Eko Atlantic project and the ocean as well as cross sections of Victoria Island, depending on your room. The OTIS elevators were a bit faulty during my visit and need some work for optimal performance. Showers and bath tubs are a bit complex to use but after a few minutes of trial and error you'd get the hang of it.

No issues, a nice firm bed, clean bathroom with good water pressure and hot water. Air conditioning is effective. Staff are friendly and helpful. The property has a number of bars and restaurants giving a variety of choice. there are 2 negatives. The first is that the restaurant ran out of eggs at breakfast which created a stir among people wanting eggs. The only feedback was 'we are trying to get some'. The second negative is the cars crowding around the entrance to the hotel. The parking attendants do not seem to control vehicles double parking and creating chaos.

Lovely stay at Eko Hotel,"I stayed here in March 2019 for 3 nights. The location was ideal for business meetings, and very close to all my business events.  I had breakfast here everyday. To be honest, the selection for hot food is not as extensive as I have seen in other 5 star Nigerian hotels, but it is passable. Unfortunately, the tea and coffee staff were inattentive and always seemed to be flaring around without really doing anything.  The front staff were polite and friendly. Had to wait for 30 minutes for my room to be ready at check-in which was not ideal after a long flight.  The highlights of the hotel are the porters and staff bringing items to your room.

I had breakfast and lunch there everyday and there was lots of variation. Also went to the Mexican one night and really enjoyed that.

Good business hotel with extensive facilities,"Rated as one of the more luxurious hotels on Victoria Island, Eko has good facilities (large gym, range of restaurants, business and conference facilities etc). The common parts are clean and the rooms are large and decorated in a 'modern' fashion. I visited here four times in 2017 for business and it feels secure. The food is fine in the restaurants, but room service quality is patchy. Nespresso machine in the room was a plus for me. Utilities are disappointing - the bath water is often cold and sometimes a yellowy-brown colour; wifi is patchy at best and there were quite regular - though brief - power outages which knocked out the tv service in the room.",November 2017,,,wrote a review Jun 2018,"Esher, United Kingdom","['13 contributions', '20 helpful votes']",30,[]
Very good hotel,"Being for the first time in Nigeria, it is a really long distance from the airport to the hotel. It takes over 2 hours especially when it is a heavy traffic. It is secured and you need to pass security checks when entering the hotel property. The hotel area has few buildings where you can enjoy a pool area which is not only for the hotel guests. My trip was business and I have had only BB. The breakfast offer was European food including several local dishes. The rooms are spacious, air conditioned, very clean. The water is not for drinking so prepare yourself a few bottles (even though the hotel is offering a few). The personnel is oleasant and profesional and speak very good English.

It is commendable how such beauty can be carved out in such a busy environment. Food is amazing as you want it, you've got different restaurant for choice of meal. Room is amazing as well. 24hrs Internet and a very lively lobby.

A world apart,"Eko Hotel is ideally located in a huge and well secured compound in the middle of Victoria Island, Lagos city center.  International standard hotel. But more safe and convenient than cozy or charming. A bit aging decor. Heady atmosphere.

Too Big for Service,I normally stay in a different hotel on my business trips to Lagos and on advise from someone decided to try the Eko Hotel.  I really have mix feelings about this hotel and these feelings mostly go to the negative side.  It is a 8 day trip and I feel that this hotel for a longer stay is not ideal.  Where do I starts........restaurant's...........according to the website the hotel features various restaurants which is true but the selection is in fact very limited.  The menu's is very limited and although 2 restaurant's is suppose to be outside it actually serve the same food.  The Room Service menu is actually bigger than that of the restaurant's.

The room wasn't sound-proofed and I got no sleep the first night; the second night was better because I got hold of some earplugs. In general, even numbered rooms seemed to be away from the generator and odd numbered rooms were above it.

Fully adequate conference hotel (for Lagos),"Near the beach, this complex includes the Eko Hotels and the Eko Signature hotel and conference center. Or ""centre"" for you Brit-spellers. The Signature is a somewhat better hotel and large suites are available at relatively steep prices by African standards. Service is decent and maintenance fair. Breakfast buffet acceptable but unimpressive. Chinese, Italian and Mexican food available in addition to Nigerian food.   Prices are fairly high. Quality is adequate. Local transportation is not safe or reliable so you should consider a driver if you are going anywhere. If this hotel were anywhere else it might be a bit lower rating, but hey.  Wifi is horrible. New codes must be received from the desk daily. Count on entering it every hour or more.

The rooms were good, and the conference facility was excellent! The food was great too. I would recommend this facility is you have business in Lagos, and need a comfortable place to stay. However, I found a few things very odd, particularly for a hotel as premium as this.  The facility overall is neat, well maintained, and the rooms are spacious enough. What I found odd was the trouble I had ordering room service.

Mixed experience,"I spent a couple of months (!) at the Eko Hotel in Lagos (Main Building), and got quite a good idea about pros and cons of the property. In a nutshell: It's definitely not 5 star, maybe a 4 star at the lower end, but it wasn't to be expected either.   In a hotel it's all about people, and the quality of the staff at the Eko covers a broad range. Receptionists overall are excellent, housekeeping can be very good, too (Joseph, for example, was extraordinary). Waiters and waitresses at the restaurant can be quite slow and inattentive, although over the months I learned how to deal with it (tipping regularly, that is). Michael and Pita were outstanding though and did a great job.   Facility-wise I experienced too many hick-ups and  deficiencies. The three most obvious ones:  1.

The dining hall is nice to look at. And that's where it ends. The shower curtain and tub looks rather old and stained.

A small bath with a shower that you have to crouch under to take a shower was not acceptable. Maybe remove the bath and just have a walk in shower. The staff were not as polite as some of the hotels i have stayed at in Lagos, but it is a busy hotel so if you are visiting alone there is always someone to talk to. The breakfast in the hotel was not that good, but the other restaurants within the hotel were ok. It is a very expensive hotel to eat and drink.

Terrible is a nicer description,"I don't know how best to really describe this place. It's a tragedy.   Eko Hotel is the most popular destination for events in Nigeria but then Nigerians do cope with just anything.  1 - Parking is very difficult. You could be stuck in the underground parking or overflow for up to 1 hour. Absolutely zero coordination.  2 - The reception is almost open air. Mosquitoes reign supreme. The staff are clueless and the place a security risk: different characters mingle with guests and many have free access by hitching on the elevators up. Commercial sex workers jostles with others.  3 - The rooms are terrible! Dirty, dated, poorly done, whatever you can think of. to imagine this to be a top class hotel is just a shame.

The room was not bad but I made a mistake when I asked for a room which was oriented into a direction of Victoria Island. The noise from outside air conditioning generators was pretty loud...

Best and safest hotel in Lagos,The Hotel is on Victoria Island. It is very secured (got even own outpost). From my point of view it is a best Hotel to stay in Lagos for business needs. You can take taxi to airport from reception for 6000 naira.

"Nice hotel, although parts could use a bit of sprucing up","I stayed in the old tower.  The first thing I noticed is that the hallways are dark until you come almost immediately upon a motion sensor, and then a very localized light turns on just in front of you,while ones behind you turn off.  When it is dark, you cannot see very far down the hall.  also, the paint on the walls in the hallway really need to be spruced up - it looks beat up.  i had selected a non-smoking room and was on a non-smoking floor, however, my room smelled like an ash tray.  i do not know if it was because a prior guest smoked in there, guests around me, or if it just came through the ventilation system.

Not only did the room smell badly of mould but the furniture and carpet was mouldy and the wooden furniture had expanded/exploded at the base because of water damage. I explained this to one manager and his initial reaction was that I had a sensitive nose. On asking him to come up to my room and look he did finally agree that the room had a mould problem.

The pool was in the middle of the hotel in a very busy area. The internet vouchers were issued on a daily basis you could not get one that would last you the duration of your stay. I left my charger in one meeting room and guys on duty could not be bothered to open it for me to pick it up, asking me to wait for the Manager on duty who no one knew when he was coming back  The food was good though had a lot of local variety and also the european buffet.

Nice hotel as long you don't see the rooms...,"The Eko location, by the sea, is great. The hotel complex being furthermore large, it helps foreign travellers feeling less ""trapped"" if they do not want to go outside by night.

Check-in was smooth. I got a room almost at the top of the hotel. When getting to my floor though, I found the corridor very faded. The door of the room was quite loose (although it locked well). The room was very oldish. While the bed was all right and the bathroom somewhat refurbished, I had the overall impression it was 30+ years old (i.e. from the late 70s when the hotel was built).

The room was quite standard, very far away from the elevator but reasonable sized. For cleanliness, I have to give the hotel a zero.

Friendly staff doing their best,"The staff and the location are the best features of this hotel. The staff are very friendly and ready to help (although some rubbed me off wrongly). If you need something done in Victoria Island/Ikoyi, this is probably a good place to stay to avoid the traffic when coming from the mainland. The sea-view rooms are small, the city-view rooms are larger, the suites are not really suites. The room service menu is limited but the food quality is good if you can manage the monotony.

Good Hotel - Slightly Overpriced,"Of the choices of hotels you have in Lagos for large events, there's not many I would rate higher than this hotel (Except maybe the Federal Palace).   The hotel is located on Victoria Island, so about 50 minutes from the Airport in ok traffic (up to 4 hours in bad afternoon traffic so be careful when you're checking out).  The rooms are good and clean, decent selection of TV Channels and the Room Service food is very good (though overpriced - but then again so is everything else in Lagos).  Things to watch out for:  - Water - like anywhere else in Africa, don't drink or even rinse your mouth with tap water - The Electricity gets disconnected at least 4-5 times a day then the generators kick in a few seconds later - don't let it bother you - When checking out, allow for 30-40",December 2012,,,wrote a review Dec 2012,"Valkenswaard, The Netherlands","['185 contributions', '82 helpful votes']",30,[]

It's not even a suite, it's just slightly bigger than the rooms in the main hotel. I've seen the cleaner cleaned the room, most times and they are really not big on cleanliness. The mop that they use to clean was dirty and the water was black! I had to use another floor wipes after they have mop the floor, and it's ridiculously black!  The shower was always leaking..the floor of the toilet wet, because of the leak. If you ask them to fix something, they will bring 2-3 people, but nothing is fixed.
