Quiet and compact sized feel,"Well maintained guest house/compact size hotel. I stayed in one of the rooms ground floor. It is spacious, smelt fresh and facilities work pretty fine. You have quite a variety of cable tv stations to select/watch; from news, sports to movies channels etc - and the pictures/sound are clear. The free wifi work well. I only had issues with the bathroom shower cubicle. No soap dish inside the cubicle but outside. So you have to come out with soap on you to keep on the dish outside. Towel hanger was far from the shower cubicle. The positions were odd for me. Their food? Hmmm, it was tasty and a bit pricey. The location? it's centrally located and it's just a walking distance from the popular Shoprite, other restaurants  and banks. Room rates are reasonable and you get value for your",July 2017,Traveled on business,The rooms are quiet,wrote a review Jul 2017,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria","['48 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_30', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
Quiet and homely,"Well maintained, guest house, with somewhat of a quality B&B feel. The room (Executive suite) was well laid out, with ample space. However the lighting in the room can be improved (it was a bit dingy). Room service was good; most of the staff were warm and helpful, particularly Daniel the Manager, who handled the room booking. The restaurant is passable. Taxi services available at a cost; this we found very convenient.

Great place,"MOYOSORE OLANREWAJU Hotel situated on VI, good security and friendly staff, nice small pool but the rooms are far not to the standard you expect for the price charged. Bathroom very old and need update! Another issue was that the price for the room we had confirmed from London suddenly changed after a few days and also the price for their taxi went up within a few days after we arrived with absolutely no notice. We didn't appreciate that the deal we had not being honoured and ended up moving to another hotel. We thought this wasn't very professional. Sadly in Nigeria everything goes up as soon as they see people from Europe. “ Great hotel”",November 2012,,,wrote a review Oct 2013,,['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_50', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Felt like home,"La Playa was my first home in Lagos. Our family was waiting for our house to be completed, so we stayed in the hotel for one week. The staff made us feel welcome and always helped with anything we needed. I don't think I ever had to open the front doors myself! Our daughter loved seeing the staff and giving everyone a high five. Our room was always cleaned to the highest standards. They made us feel at home. Wonderful hotel and staff, can't wait to visit them again! Oh yea, the food was very yummy with 24 hour service.",September 2013,Traveled on business,Thursday night is ladies night so it can get a little loud,wrote a review Sep 2013,"Denver, Colorado","['34 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
One of the friendliest places I've ever stayed at,"I was slightly apprehensive on my first visit to Lagos, but all my fears melted away after walking into La Playa suites. Not only are the staff friendly and helpful, the management go out of their way to make you feel at home. As many previous reviewers have stated it is a home away from home. The owners are great and make you feel relaxed and tell you everything you need to know, and you get to meet the other guests as well.   The bar/restaurant has everything you need, good conversation, cold beer and a good range of spirits. The food is also good.not haute cuisine, but good home cooked food. More importantly, its very well prepared - Not once did I get a dodgy stomach, which is common in other hotels.   Great place to watch sports and the TVs are hooked up to a UPS so when",February 2013,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Mar 2013,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['59 contributions', '35 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_30', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Home from Home,"I visit Lagos on a monthly basis and always stay at the LaPlaya in VI. The staff are first class and there is nothing to much trouble for them. They put the guests needs first and always deliver a service with a smile. The kitchen is excellent and the 24 hour room service is second to none. I always look forward to arrving at the La Playa as I know I'm going to receive a warm welcome and a good clean and safe stay there. The fact that they have so many Ex Pat  clients speaks volumes for the quality of service. The Night staff are always available and on hand for any needs that the guests require. All in All, a very friendly and warm place to lodge for business or pleasure visits to Lagos. Look forward to my next stay..",November 2012,Traveled on business,The upstairs rooms are quieter due to the car parking area.,wrote a review Dec 2012,Port Harcourt.,['1 contribution'],40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"

Five star service from top to bottom.,"My wife and I spent 7 nights in La Playa Hotel. Nearly everything was excellent. Five star service from top to bottom. The rooms were very clean and comfortable; the kitchen was perhaps too excellent; the laundry was great and the staff did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. The restaurant/bar is friendly and provides an environment that encourages people to mix. The owners, Ralph and Gina, were fantastic hosts. By the time we left, we felt like we were old friends. Unlike some hotels in Nigeria, the owners are willing to invest to improve: A new flat screen television appeared halfway through our stay. The hotel offered both free wireless and two internet terminals.  First-rate all the way. We highly recommend this hotel.",May 2011,Traveled on business,,wrote a review May 2011,"Oakland, California","['10 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"

A fantastic hotel with wonderful staff & the best food in Lagos,"I was recomended this hotel by mates who visit from PH, and stay at La Playa as first choice, when in Lagos. Owned by a Brit and evrything has been done to ensure you have a pleasant stay the minute you drive through the main gates.  The hotel is not one of these huge impersonal complexes, but a nice size if you prefer the more personal service and environment. Good location for all the IOCs and finance district. 4x4 or Car/driver available from the hotel - all with good driving skills and safety awareness. Checkin/Reception: Really efficient and staff genuinely pleased to welcome you into the hotel. Always helpful and can't do enough for you. Bar/Restaurant A huge menu available 24 hours a day. Coffee is served in large cafetiers so endless high quality coffee is great for",March 2011,,,wrote a review Mar 2011,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom","['430 contributions', '198 helpful votes']",50,[]
Astonishing find - so close to the action on Victoria Island,"Unexpectedly, a very reasonably priced hotel so close to the business centre of Victoria Island. Recently refurbished rooms diligently cleaned every day and staff friendly and conscious of guests' practical needs.  Very impressed by poolside BBQ on Saturday when an excellent band plays and Thursday is ladies night when its heaving inside -- a good location for getting around, either to VI or Lekki and hire car(s) available at the reception if required. One important point was the internet - it's relatively fast and free and I was pleasantly surprised when the resident IT guy took great pains to get me online despite the fact it was probably the fault of my own laptop. At first I wondered about the quiet locoation but security in the area is really tight - just easy walking",March 2011,,,wrote a review Mar 2011,Accra,['1 contribution'],50,[]
Best Hotel,"I've stayed in a few hotels around Lagos and non of them has the same standard has La playa. The rooms are very clean, modernized.  La playa suites is  a place i call home and each time i go back there i never want to leave. The staff there are friendly and the food is just to die for.  It's well situated in the heart of Lagos and very easy to commute, and a shopping center just 10mins walking distance. I love this hotel, has i feel safe each time i am there.",August 2010,,,wrote a review Mar 2011,"London, United Kingdom",['1 contribution'],40,[]
