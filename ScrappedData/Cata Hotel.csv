Great experience,"Lovely apartment with friendly reception staff ( Esther and Doris) who made our stay memorable. Stayed in the one bedroom which also had a sofa bed in the living area. Only downside was the noise from the pool party on one of the nights. Otherwise, highly recommended.",December 2020,,,wrote a review Dec 2020,,['2 contributions'],50,"['Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
Very nice and affordable,"I stayed at the Cata Apartment Hotel during my latest trip to Nigeria in February 2015. I was very impressed with the cleanliness and amenities of the hotel. It's location is very close and central to the airport. The hotel staff were very courteous. I booked a double bed room with two adults. We were supposed to be served free breakfast, which was included in the price of the room. I was surprised when told that only one adult gets free breakfast, and we have to pay for the other adult. I insisted that the reservation was for two adults, and both have to get free breakfast. The staff contacted the manager, and we both had our free breakfast. Besides this incident, we were satisfied with the service. Their breakfast was good.",February 2015,Traveled with friends,The free wi fi didn't work because of network issue.,wrote a review Mar 2015,"Minneapolis, Minnesota","['17 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"

"Yellow Tulip Courtyard, Nice hotel at a good rate","For my first time in Lagos, I felt safe in this hotel. Everybody was very courteous, very helpful and with friendly faces. This hotel is not well known but should be as it is at a good rate compare to some overpriced hotel. My daughter enjoyed the pool as it was over 30 degrees when we went, The food was excellent. Bonne chance aux proprietaires, well done and If I were to come back to Lagos, I d go back to Yellow Tulip Courtyard.",November 2011,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Dec 2011,"London, United Kingdom","['1 contribution', '4 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
