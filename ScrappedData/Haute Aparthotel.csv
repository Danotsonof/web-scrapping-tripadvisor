A Safe Haven,Found this place at a desperate moment when we needed an apartment to stay in just barely arriving to Nigeria to relocate in Lagos from Uganda - this small hotel proved to be a perfect find great price and great staff waiting to meet any need we would have. I highly recommend this place for one night or one month. Management is outstanding. 24 hour security and electricity with ac's and clean rooms. Less than 10 minutes from airport and Ikeja City Mall.,April 2015,,,wrote a review May 2015,"Lagos, Nigeria","['52 contributions', '15 helpful votes']",50,[]
