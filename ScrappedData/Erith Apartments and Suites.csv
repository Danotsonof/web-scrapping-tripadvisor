Return visit,"Last reviewed this place in 2015 when I stayed over.  Tough economic times are challenging for hospitality entrepreneurs the world over - including Nigeria.  Check-in quick and bags taken to room. Staff attention to requests still good. AC working fine. Wifi not up to scratch this time - reported it to reception - repeated problems with connection - granted weather may have an effect - pouring with rain most of the visit.   Increasing need for various maintenance issues in standard room taken for the duration of stay.  No change in acceptable breakfast, took dinner twice and bill of fare is acceptable.",March 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2017,"Greater Johannesburg, South Africa","['204 contributions', '87 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"
Some indications of Difficult Economic times,Have been visiting Lagos for some time and this establishment a few times.  As usual check-in quick and smooth. Room allocated had trouble with shower - was promptly moved to another room. It was explained that maintenance was due to be undertaken soon on a number of rooms. The second room appeared to be in need of some general maintenance but did not detract from the stay or sleep (5 nights).   Wifi service reliability has definitely improved! Only problem was the only room available for me was outside wifi range - used the punge. Security is still good. Had more power outages that on previous stay - possibly to do with apparent current fuel shortages.   My taxi service was carry a spare full fuel can this time.,November 2015,Traveled on business,Careful with choosing roomed named Joy - wifi currently out of reach,wrote a review Nov 2015,"Greater Johannesburg, South Africa","['204 contributions', '87 helpful votes']",30,"['Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
"Convenient, Secure and Value for Money","I have been visiting Ikeja, Lagos from some years. More recently due to pressure on budgets, I have been on the lookout for a hotel/lodge in Ikeja which would suit my needs, still provide secure accommodation and be in close proximity to businesses I visit in Lagos.  The Erith Apartment Suites, Located in Awuse Estate,  has certainly provided me with three of my key requirements which are a competitive Lagos price, location and above average accommodation (most of my meals are outside hotel). Although the breakfasts were modest (often basic or sometimes Nigerian oriented cuisine) they were fresh and service was prompt.  I arrived latish (after 10 pm) due to a flight delay but check-in was quick and efficient.  Staff were always accommodating and helpful. Room was clean on",June 2015,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jun 2015,"Greater Johannesburg, South Africa","['204 contributions', '87 helpful votes']",40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']"
