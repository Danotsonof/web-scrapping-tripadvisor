Service Makes The Difference,"Excellent staff and service at this functional hotel in Lagos. Membership was recognized, rooms were clean and overall a fine experience.

Extremely Disappointing Stay,"Very stressful and disappointing stay. Room was not ready when we first arrived and we had to wait until one was ready, despite checking in on the app. When I finally got into the room, it was humid and the ceiling was leaking and had to be fixed. Additionally, the air conditioning did not work and when maintenance person arrived to fix the ceiling, I pointed out the air issue and he (frustratingly) insisted it was just me not knowing how to work it, even though it clearly didn‚Äôt work even when he made the ‚Äúcorrect adjustments‚Äù (though it ultimately was proven that the system just wouldn‚Äôt get cooler - it wasn‚Äôt me not knowing).   I asked to be moved but was asked to remain in the room for a night with a promise a new room the next day, so no sleep to say the least as someone",September 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Oct 2023,,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",10,[]
"Horrible experience, should not be a Marriott Bonvoy property","Highly recommend NOT staying at this hotel. The rooms are not clean.  The air in the rooms is damp and moldy and the AC doesn't work well.  If you like a smelly room that is 25-28 degrees, this is the hotel for you.  After moving to a different room, the AC worked ok, but the bed was horrible. I did not sleep well.  I can not see how this hotel maintains the Bonvoy/Sheraton brand.

Poor maintenance. 1*,"This hotel is now a rundown 1* hotel. I stayed here a few years ago but clearly there has been no ongoing maintenance and the new management are doing a poor job.  Our room smelt like urine, no soaps, broken furniture and more. They changed our room after we complained and upgraded us to a much larger suite that was slightly cleaner but had limited light sources.  The breakfast area was old, not maintained and the food not fresh. Even the frying pans used to make eggs looked like they had not been replaced in years. Very unhygienic.    As a Marriott Elite member I was appalled and believe that the Marriott standard does not exist here.

Very average experience,"Very good room, large and well equipped. Well cleaned and good services. Only one small bar on the second floor, outside bar area is very dark, inside no tables, I would rate this very basic for a Sheraton. The restaurant is also basic, one big empty room with no atmosphere, may as well be a canteen. Breakfast is supposed to start at 6.30 am but no point in going at this time as less than half of the items are available, no chef at the egg station, toaster did not work and I struggled to get a coffee out of the coffee machine. I stayed for over a week and on a few occasions resorted to having a coffee in the coffee shop on the ground floor where the staff, especially Sarah Ukpeh were very helpful.

A Pleasurable Experience! ü§© üè®,"Four Points By Sheraton is a hotel that I've been passing by for years, especially when heading to The Palms Mall @ Lekki. It appears to 'sit' on the border of Victoria Island and Lekki. I've always wanted to stay here, but never got the opportunity to do so until now. Booking was super easy on Booking.com, and upon arrival, the check-in process was a breeze. I'll divide this review into the 'Positives' and the 'Negatives', as I customarily do.   PROS: First of all, the entire hotel is lovely!üòç This includes the lobby, rooms, swimming pool and other environs. Except for some scaffolding/repairs, everything about the hotel appeared neat, clean and orderly. The exterior of the hotel is kempt and well-maintained. Our room was beautifully decorated.

"Deteriorated over the years - musty, leaky, terrible","This hotel has deteriorated since my husband and I stayed there ten years ago. During this stay we ended up changing rooms three times. First, we were allegedly upgraded to a suite based on my husband‚Äôs status in the Marriott Rewards program. When we arrived at our room, it was certainly not a suite. We called down and were told they did not have any available suites but persuaded to stay in the ‚Äúnice‚Äù room we were given. We agreed. Within the first day, the ceiling developed a leak, which was attributed to a faulty air conditioning duct system. Their maintenance crew could not fix it so we were moved to a second room. The minute we walked into the second room we knew we couldn‚Äôt stay there - the air smelled horribly musty and the dead bolt on the door was broken.

AWESOME EXPERIENCE,The reception was spectacular. The little interracrion I had with a few staff made me conclude that they have a well trained staff members who truly love and enjoy what they do.   Amazing food as well. ..oh yea! I had chicken wings and fries. I must say I enjoyed every bite.  I happened to also meet the Geeneral Manager - one Mr Patik ( not aure of the spelling) He is a very warm peraon.  We spoke briefly about covod and its impact on hospitality.

Brasserie Sunday Brunch: Pasta Station worth it. Not much else for $32USD EACH,"Posted 12noon start time isnt possible per the Head Chef.  Well, they were supposed to start at 12:30p and somethings were ready at 12:44pm.   The pasta station is what led me to choose this brunch offering. They have Alfredo and Red marina sauce. No pesto. Actually, no basil available at all.   The chef said ask for what you want and they'll deliver. Well, basil never showed and I was befuddled no one considered the bar would have basil and floored that the kitchen didn't have it all.   The buffet includes:  Salad bar with coleslaw.  Some salad fixings  Pitted olives  Some dressings but no blue cheese, ranch, balsamic neither Italian. They have french, oil, mayo based Thousand Island and soy sauce that wasn't labeled so I thought it was balsamic.

A Fall from Grace,"Very disappointing to see this hotel go from international standard 2 years ago to below average now.    I absolutely loved the hotel during my last stay 2 years ago so I was surprised to see it run down so quickly.   Upon arriving, there was a stench in hotel lobby, lack of maintenance all around was apparent, checkin was smooth and fast. Room was not as impressive, mattress and pillows were old and worn out, the bed did not feel sturdy. Bathroom was the worst as there was no wash cloth, I inquired and they said there was none in the entire hotel due to some supply problems. Towels were worn out.  The food was still good though and room service was prompt. Staff was nice and professional.  I did not enjoy my room and didn‚Äôt feel I was getting value for my money.

"Great staff, good rooms, awesome breakfast","We spent two nights at this hotel on our visit to Lagos. We were given a Bonvoy upgrade to the top floor, which gave us a huge, comfortable, well-appointed room. The only challenge is that the hot water is pumped up from lower floors, according to what we were told. So it takes quite some time to get to the top. We thought something was wrong, but it was explained to us an we adjusted. No big deal.  The breakfast was included and amazing. There was so much variety, so plentiful and tasty. The coffee machines were annoying, but were eventually conquered. The staff were the best - Emmanuel and others at the front desk, breakfast crew and Managers.

Instead we were met with mould in every of the three rooms we tried, worn-down furniture and a constant smell of a hotel in a desperate need of a total make over. It was so humid in the room, that the door to the bathroom could not even close properly and while sleeping it felt like all the bedsheets are soaked in a little bit of water. The mould was visible on the walls and the ceiling, and, of course, in the bathroom. Not to mention other little details like missing light, broken hair dryer, chipped furniture.

Lacking attention to detail,The property overall was okay. There are many things that could make this hotel much better. I was booked here for Valentine's Day. The bed slept okay and I enjoyed the spa services. Our room was situated on the side of the hotel with what I would consider the best view. It overlooked the 2nd floor restaurant/lounge. The food at The Office was pretty basic but tasted fine. One should not be concerned about cleanliness when checking into a reputable hotel. The spa towels and robes were very dingy. I don't know about anyone else but drying off with a towel that doesn't appear very clean is not fun. There was also a towel left on the floor inside the spa shower for me to step out on that was visibly black and had been used/walked on several times prior to my arrival.

In all my travels around the world, I have never experienced such a horrid hotel stay. If you‚Äôve ever been to Nigeria then you know the elation of having a nice long shower after a day out in the sun and humidity. We checked in on Thursday for our wedding weekend, after the wedding on Friday (long exhausting day) we returned to the hotel at 2am only to find out the hotel had no water. They claimed it was a hotel maintenance shutdown and no rooms had any water. Who schedules a water shut down during a weekend???  What option did we have but to go to bed without even the chance to wash our faces.  We were assured it‚Äôd be back on by 5:30 am.

The fresh cucumbers were delightful beside the butter gentle SPICY Egusi  and Smashed Yam.  YUM!  Almost every evening after that we chose to eat outside at the Rooftop Bar (The Office).

However, only downsides this time were: -On arrival I needed a trolley for my cases which were relatively heavy. Spent atleast 5 mins with the security staff at the door looking at me and offered no help. I had to ask and they walked in to call for a porter. -The front desk were unable to make changes to my reservation after I made severally unanswered calls before Arrival.

Bad smell in the rooms,"Stayed here a couple of times, but I have to say I'm going to look for new options. While the hotel is not bad for Lagos standards - big rooms, very good service etc, I cannot stand the mold smell anymore. It's everywhere at the hotel, especially in the rooms, and all my clothes end of smelling mold by the time I leave. Strongly suggest a renovation/a way to fix this smell.

Not a bad choice but could be so much better,The hotel has a small reception which is partly a coffee bar over;looking a general area.  On the ground floor there is the main sports bar which is always full of smoke and the staff are inattentive.  There is one restaurant for breakfast and buffet dinner which is clearly aimed at local guests.  Some days the food was appetising whereas others it was not. There is also a rooftop bar restaurant but this is packed with locals and there is no space for hotel guests.  They do serve food but the tables are low and the food not great.  The rooms on the other hand are large but there are tiled floors.  The beds are comfortable and there is a large flat screen tv and well proportioned bathrooms.  Reception is prompt and efficient.

Functional Rooms and Lovely Patio Restaurant/Bar,"I have to say, hotels in Lagos are nothing to write about generally. The Fourpoints is no exception in that the service is average by global hospitality standards and the rooms are marginal but comfortable depending on your luck; with some rooms being better than others. Security is tight and that is a big deal for some so it is worth mentioning.    What I do enjoy about this hotel is their 'roof top' patio bar and restaurant.

It is getting worse....,"I have been staying in this hotel since it first opened. I have read reviews on the site and I feel like I was staying in a different hotel to people who reviewed the hotel. It is all right but.... the rooms are looking more tired, there is no pressure in the shower or hot water in the evening sometimes or it takes ages to get any hot water. The bathroom is tired, the tiles are chipped and it just needs some maintenance. The staff in the restaurant are only interested in you signing for the meal especially at breakfast, the quality of breakfast has gone down massively over the last 3 years.

Would not recommend due to loud music blaring until 2am....,"If you are staying here for business and need to be up at an early hour prepare to be sleep-deprived. There is loud music being played until the wee hours of the morning on the front street facing side of the hotel - so, if you are on that side of the hotel there is music blaring outdoors until 2am - and this is after the live band plays until 11pm. I called the front desk at 1:45am in the morning to ask them to turn the music off - as there were no guests outside and just hotel staff - and I was informed ""the music will be off at 2am.""

"Clean, efficient and secure","I stayed at this hotel about 18 months ago and my overall stay was pleasant. Staff was attentive me my room was large and spotless. My reason for giving it four rather than five star is this very odd habit they have of checking bags before getting on the elevator to ensure that no outside food is brought in. Really? Also, I visited the outside lounge with a friend which I can say is very nice and relaxing, if not a tad overpriced. For a hotel that holds high standards, I was a bit put off by the waiter chasing me down the hallway to pay. I had already left my name and room number and I am not used to be harangued for money in hotels.

Damp,"Stayed for three nights at the Four Points and was really disappointed by the quality of the hotel.

Nice staff but A/C is bad,"I stayed there few days for business. Staff at reception was super friendly, however the overall experience was mixed.

In addition the A/C is quite loud and disturbs at night. The hotel goes thru renovation and there is some impact in front of the hotel, butthey make it clear before arrival - no issue, understandable. However there is also large construction site next to the hotel raising a tall tower, just few meters from Four Points, so some rooms have almost no sun light - the dark under-construction building takes most of light (quite depressing, even on 4th floor).

Disappointing - Not as good as previous years,"I come here two or three times for work a year. I either stay here or at the Intercontinental.

The positives: Good breakfast, decent sports bar, a nice gym and reasonably clean room.  Negatives: There used to be a lovely outdoor patio up on the third floor to sit outside which is now just an ugly construction site which means there is nowhere to enjoy the weather. My booking stated my room comes with a view which is actually just green plastic and scaffolding. I feel I should have been told of the construction.

Everything works as it should,"After a change in company policy I've moved back to staying at the Four Points, with 2 visits so far this year.

Not so impressed this time,"I had a terrible situation in the middle of the night - a very loud crackling sound coming from within my room and sending me dashing out for safety.

After calling for security to come and investigate it turned out that the floor tiles were RIPPING themselves apart from the concrete floor. Quite in UNBELIEVABLE sight (and sound).   What disappointed me most was the casual manner in which I was handled, in fact men trooped into my room and basically bundled me and my belongings out as quickly as possible (quickly enough for me not to remember to take a picture).

First Impressions Matter,"Right off the bat, I didn't like this hotel. It wasn't the building, which is reasonably fresh and new. It wasn't the people at reception who were very friendly and competent. It was the signs when you came in. ""Absolutely No Outside Food or Drink is Allowed in the Hotel"" is the first sign you see as you are waiting for security to do their inspection of your car. Then you see that large sign again as you pass through the metal detector on your way to the lobby. (They are serious about it, by the way - I watched security chase a guy down that had brought in a Dominos Pizza, and made him fill out forms).

The have a very attentive staff in the Lobby Lounge. I stayed on a Non Smoking 4 Star Room and it was very clean but little amenities (in fact none in the bathroom). The Room is large and clean with the Housekeeping clearly taking pride in their work. The TV is of good quality with good selection and the Air Con is good and provides a good blast. Towels are changed daily. The electronic key system works well and the lifts were fully operational! We only had breakfast and it has a good international range.

Drinks & snacks in cafe,We went to the hotel to meet my son in law's colleagues. Unfortunately we were unable to go to the terrace bar as we had a small child with us. Staff were very courteous and explained that you can only take children onto the outdoor terrace before 7 pm.  My daughter and I therefore returned to the ground floor cafe where there is a comfy seating area. Again the staff were delightful - we mistakenly had picked up a bar menu rather than the cafe menu - this was easily sorted out by the cafe server who rang our order through to the bar. We enjoyed our snacks and drinks very much.

God for a short stay,The Four Points should generally be a five star hotel.  However this one has a few deficiencies.  The entry is through a small car park to a reception that has a few chairs.  To the right is a coffee bar area leading to a dark and smokey bar area without windows.  On the first floor there is a restaurant which also covers breakfast.  It is buffet by nature and the food is really rather unappetising.  You can get food in the smokey bar on the ground floor or on the small roof area on the second floor but in all cases the menu is severely limited and provides little to excite an international pallet.  The rooms on the other hand are both spacious and comfortable and clean.  The Spa has an outside pool  with four loungers beside it.

"Lagos Four Points - Clean, secure but very lonely","I was there on a Business trip Monday thru Friday and the Entry check in was fast, friendly and efficient, by the way also was the check out - fast and efficient, really impressive over my expectation. One little disturbance was the decline of my AMEX credit card, which does not happen very often, especially in an International chain hotel - very surprising!

There are lots of parking spaces and if you don't drive you can catch a cab just outside of the complex easily. they will think you have lots of money as you are staying there so be careful that they do not overcharge.  It is one of those rare hotels where you can still get a smoking room. My room was spacious and had everything I needed for a relaxing get away.

Friendly business hotel,"Down decent business hotel. Stayed here for 3 months and in different rooms, so got a good detailed look at it. Honestly, I was undecided between 3 and 4 stars and the truth probably lies inbetween. The reason I opted for 4 is that staff is really friendly and tries to make your life more comfortable. On the plus side, the rooms have a decent size, location is rather central, gym is quite good and food decent. Now on the negative, the rooms, especially the bathrooms could do with an overhaul, the food menu is quite limited and gets boring within a couple of days, internet is average and the service is, although friendly, sometimes inconsistent.

We ordered a bottle of wine with dinner and it was delivered unopened after we had almost finished eating. I asked if they had a corkscrew and the waiter eventually opened the bottle. My room was just ok. It had tile floors and my feet stuck to whatever they used to clean the floor. The air conditioning blew extremely humid and not do cold air. One last problem was that, like many chain hotels, this hotel didn't have a top sheet, but rather one of those comforter/sheet covers.

This means that in the middle of the night, in the pitch black, asleep and disoriented (the 1st night at least), you have to remember where you left the room card, as no light works, or feel your way across the cold floor, to the bathroom.

"Good location, nice people","It's a nice hotel with a nice sportsbar, a terrace restaurant and a normal restaurant. All of those are good, sometimes service can be a bit slow though. Hotel pool not really recommended. Did not check the gym.  Rooms are spacious and clean. Try to get a room facing away from the street (due to car noise and sometimes music from the terrace bar).  Location is good for business on VI. But Lagos traffic is always bad, so make sure to take that into account.  In general the hotel is not as good anymore as it has been 1-2 years ago.

Nice comfortable hotel,"The hotel is nice and well maintained. The rooms are clean but the view is disturbing as it is still VI. The bathing room is clean but somehow not comfortable as the shower inside the bath. The AC works but makes much noise and it stops when reaching the selected degree. The breakfast is fair and basic, the service is excellent. The GYM is clean and has all the relevant facilities. A big draw back is that there is no garden. I would recommend the hotel as it is still VI.",July 2015,,,wrote a review Jul 2015,"Ra'anana, Israel",['11 contributions'],40,[]

A spa hotel with a difference,"I spent 8 pretty comfortable nights in this hotel which has some excellent features. The room was very large and well equipped - perfect for business or pleasure. The bathroom was adequate but the hot water took a long time to come through in the shower and then wasn't blistering hot, but certainly adequate for the climate.  The air conditioning was very loud and I had to turn it off to sleep, but the bed was really comfy with large, fluffy pillows. I was disappointed that there was no decaf coffee available in the room and one day my room was nit even looked at, so I arrived back from work with no coffee or milk and an unmade bed.

Convenient an decent quality,This has become my favored place to stay in Lagos. I've been three times this year. It's a lot cheaper than the intercontinental and wheat baker for example but a good enough quality experience.   The food in the restaurant is pretty good and the coffee good in the cafeteria. There is an outside deck bar on the second floor which does excellent charcoal grilled food - I like the fish and the suya and the staff are very friendly and helpful. There is a decent gym and spa too and the rooms are quite nice. I prefer the ones higher up and facing the Oriental and the expressway rather the lower down ones on the side with the bar deck.

The public areas are well maintained, you feel good and safe there, staff always carry a smile on their face which is quite good. I've tried the restaurant and both bars, and i can say you don't have many options from the menu, the staff is kind and food is ok but the service is a little slow.

In no time the manager arrived with medical staff to attend to me. Even some of the restaurant staff showed concern and kept enquiring about my recovery.

The staff are friendly and helpful but none of them knew about the option to get Emirates miles instead of SPG points, despite a big sign in reception!! Also the outside bar plays loud music until very late  so if you have a room on the wrong side of the hotel you will have your sleep disturbed. Even on the fifth floor it was still very loud!

Must be a 4 star only,The hotel is new and rooms are fresh as compared to hotels such as EKO however the positives just end there.  The checkin was painfully long after a long flight and check out was even longer because they wanted to charge me for breakfast additionally for a room which had breakfast included.   The breakfast spread is very very small..however they do give an option for you to take the coffee in a take away cup which I really liked.  The car rental inside the hotel actually has nothing to do with the hotel somehow e.g you can not get the airport pick up bill added to your room but have to pay them separately.   The hotel does not really give you an option to check out late because apparently their system is programmed to charge for half day room rent if the stay goes beyond 1 PM,January 2015,,,wrote a review Feb 2015,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['138 contributions', '48 helpful votes']",20,[]

Not great for business travel,"Whilst the rooms and food were of a good standard, service was quite poor for a Sheraton hotel.   I was particularly upset that they failed to arrange my airport transfer. As a woman travelling alone in Lagos I like to arrange transport to where I'm staying. Upon arrival at the hotel (after having to take any old taxi from the airport) they offered no apologies. In my opinion they should have offered some kind of compensation but instead, upon asking them to provide me cash to pay the taxi driver and charge it to my room they said they were going to charge me 20% extra for the service. I had to kick up a fuss to get this charge revoked. Their excuse was that they used an external taxi company based at the hotel and it was their fault.

Proudly Nigerian,"Every time I come here -- and I've had a few too many stays -- I have reason to be proud to be Nigerian again.  It's not just the ambience which, for a business hotel, is excellent: the rooms are modern and classy, and the rooftop bar is stunning. It's not just the food, which is consistently of high quality even if sometimes limited in range. It's not just the fitness center, where a sometimes overzealous, but effective, spinning-class instructor pushes you to attain your fitness goals. And it's not just the men and women who work here, who are always friendly and helpful, even if service in the rooftop restaurant is sometimes a little slow.  Together, it just works.

Good location,It was the evening of the last Friday of August 2014 to celebrate my birthday which was a day earlier. Getting up to the restaurant and roof lounge was unduly difficult. Asking for ID to go eat a meal is preposterous! The security on the restaurant landing kept dropping innuendoes suggesting he wanted a 'dash'. That's bad for the image of the hotel. The restaurant offered a buffet. Mixture of all sorts from Nigerian to foreign dishes. Good egusi soup. The Chapman was good.   The band on the open roof lounge was good but they didn't dress the part. And they looked a bit unmotivated. It had drizzled earlier maybe this dampened their spirits. Chairs and tables were wet. The drinks were outrageously expensive. We had a bottle of Hennesey VSOP costs almost 4 times the normal price.,August 2014,,,wrote a review Sep 2014,"Lagos, Nigeria","['42 contributions', '16 helpful votes']",40,[]

When limited to eating at the same venue 3 times a day this does become more important as the days go by! The faux French brasserie is French only in name and fittings so don't expect any improvements on Nigerian international buffet food here! Anonymous modern building, friendly staff and high prices are synomnomus with almost all business class hotels in Lagos and elsewhere in Nigeria though some have better locations by the waterside.

Service so bad I nearly lost my will to live,"The hotel is fine and the rooms and food are ok (although the rooms did smell damp and the pool is not very nice) but the service is what really lets this place down. Most of the staff were very nice (if confused) but there were a few who are aggressive and rude. Even the simplest request (e.g. wake up call at 8am) seems to cause confusion. Then there were the multiple incidents where room service would knock on the door, I would tell them to come back later, and then they would use their key to burst in anyway, once when I was getting changed. The check out process took 40 minutes because the staff wanted to charge me extra, alleging I had had two buffet breakfasts in one day. When I explained several times that I had simply signed the bill for myself and my colleague, it took",February 2014,,,wrote a review Feb 2014,"Singapore, Singapore","['35 contributions', '50 helpful votes']",20,[]
"A terrific, safe, and convenient Business hotel","For anyone doing business with the many multinational companies in Lagos, the Four Points is a very convenient and safe location in V.I. ... literally within a 1 km drive of the HQ locations of Exxon/Mobil, Halliburton and GE.

Good Business Hotel,"This is a review based on visits over a period of time for stays and visits to the bars, and gym.   This is a good hotel with high standards which unfortunately slip from time to time.  Security is evidently taken seriously with guards always on the gates to the car park.  Reception for check in or enquiries can take more time than you would wish, with some degree of frustration.  The rooms are very good and generally well maintained.  The food in the main restaurant is excellent, though the menu in the Office and Adrenalin bars is limited and very samey. The outdoor Office Bar is a really good location and has live jazz music on weekend nights.  The gym is fairly small and can get very busy at peak times.

Excellent place to stay in Lagos,"The Four Points Lagos is an oasis of calm amidst the bustle and noise of Nigeria.

Great stay for a business trip to Lagos,"The Hotel is fairly modern, has most amenities you would expect in a business hotel from western standards. It is safe and well maintained. Great location. I have stayed four times over last two years. No complaints about the room - large space, comfy bed, nice bathroom, room to work, great for Lagos standards. Watch out for smoking/non smoking floors - if you are a non-smoker, the smoking floor can be a nightmare and they regularly ask on check-in whether you would be okay with a smoking floor - I insist on the non-smoking floors and no issues so far.

Whilst my room was really large and spacious, the aircon sounded like a jet engine whenever it came on - worked well but noisy, the desk chair was poor quality and very uncomfortable and the quality of the finishes in the bathroom are poor (damaged door, tile grouting incomplete, etc).

Functional and clean with rooms well insulated from the Lagos noise. Location great and staff attentive (Lagos is getting much better at service). They've managed to install some of the slowest lifts made making shuffling from conference area to your room painful.

Also, there were 'hidden' charges, so a price seen suddenly gets hiked with taxes and service charges. As one based in a country that doesn't do this, can be quite a shock.

Great Hotel in VI,"a very good hotel with great conference facilities .... rooms are nice... restaurant serves a good variety of food.. staff is very friendly and helpful.  There is an outside bar/terrace which is beautiful to sit during the evenings... nice music playing while you enjoy the evening breeze.  Pay attention to your bills though, on the day i was checking out a guy from the restaurant came running to me asking that i pay for breakfast separately since I'd already checked out, i almost handed him a $50 bill when i realized that my accommodation was B&B which means breakfast that morning was included in overnight charges!   be careful.. it's Nigeria after all! :))",December 2012,,,wrote a review Apr 2013,"Nairobi, Kenya","['98 contributions', '109 helpful votes']",40,[]

"Nice rooms, great restaurant and good facilities but a few small touches would make it truly world class","Stayed while on business for a couple of nights, I have stayed in quite a few hotels in Lagos now and this is quite reasonable in the room rates whilst still offering international standards. The restaurant and particularly the buffet were very passable. Couple of little bars outside and in depending on your preference both were fine. Only criticisms I would have was the usual staff being quite slow and uninterested to the point of being rude but I have come to expect this in Nigeria in general which is the only thing that reminds me where I am, but this is not the western world so you have to just accept it. Also the spa facilities whilst very good we're very overpriced in my opinion even by Nigerian standards. All in all definitely worth staying here as a cheaper alternative",July 2012,,,wrote a review Aug 2012,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['17 contributions', '31 helpful votes']",40,[]

Excellent Service.,"Lovely hotel with excellent service. I live in Lagos but was there on a retreat for 3 nights. The food was good. Facilities were functional. But what stood out for me was the service. Every complaint I had (there were a couple)was taken care of with dispatch. The staff were courteous and always ready to help. A few days after checking out, I realised that I'd lost my wallet and didn't know where exactly, I'd lost it. Having searched everywhere, I stopped by the hotel about 2 weeks later and housekeeping produced my wallet with everything intact! Infact, they had a register which stated the day it was found and I signed, stating the wallet has been returned.  Downsides: Room service always took forever and the menu is quite limited. It's also quite expensive   If you are looking",July 2012,,,wrote a review Jul 2012,"Lagos, Nigeria","['34 contributions', '24 helpful votes']",50,[]

One of the better places in Lagos,"Stayed in this hotel for about 30 nights over the last few months. Comfortable and clean rooms, although the power outages are getting worse. Check-in or check out can be very disorganised at times, but staff in general very friendly. The hotel could clearly not charge these prices for the standard they offering in Europe, but for Nigeria it is not too bad.

Bearing in mind that mains electricity barely covers 25% of the local consumption, power outages are not surprising but this hotel, at the rate they charge, should definitely run on generators 24/24. But, there are more prostitutes than in the past, alone at the bar (inside and outside) as well as with customers on the room floors.

Muslims Beware,"A nice hotel overall, but for a 4 star hotel they charge too much money, perhaps because they are bery good hotels in the city  My biggest annoyance as a Muslim visiting from Dubai is the fact that the hotel does not serve Halal Meat for the Muslims.. So i was a hardcore vegetarian with occasional seafood.. For the price i have paid for thos hotel, i was quite disappointed to see that most of the hotel staff, including that in the main restaurant had no clue what 'Halal' Muslim meat is, although Nigeria boasts a sizeable Muslim population.

Good International standard,"Living in Lagos myself, the lobby at the 4point has served as a place for business meetings for quite a while. Clean, friendly with a nice atmosphere and friendly service. After a long meeting I was too tired to drive home and decided to stay overnight. When rocking up at reception in the evening asking for a room, the rates were actually quite ok at NGN 35k. Still expensive anywhere else in the world, but good value for Lagos. Not sure why they don‚Äôt take Amex or Diners cards which I would have thought standard.  Guess one of the best compliments one can give a hotel in Lagos is that it is a good international hotel.

A good choice in a city like Lagos,"Lagos is quite an intense city, with power cuts practically every 15 minutes and a general lack of security in the streets. The choice of the hotel is very important because you'll probably end up staying there all the time after work. Building maintenance is generally known to be of very bad quality so new hotels are always strongly recommended. Four Points started its operation quite recently, so its still new. The rooms are comfortable and spacious, but the AC can sometimes be a bit noisy (I'm not an AC fan and I rarely switch it on so I'm not sure how bad it was).

Using that criteria, the hotel quickly becomes 'the Hotel to beat!' in Lagos.  It is strategically located in a cozy area, at the border of Lekki and Victoria Island and near one of the best shopping and dining malls in Lagos, the Shoprite Mall.  The ambience is great!  Breakfast is a good selection even though it stayed the same daily.  The rooms are nicely spaced with two or three large towels and small ounces of toiletries daily.

In the Front Office, Mr Femi and the ladies that I had dealings with were really great.   Other good points were that the guestroom shower was excellent with good pressure and heat and the bed in the guestrooms were very comfortable indeed.

"Nice, but room for improvement","I have stayed at the Four Points in Lagos four times on business in 2011 already. Suffice to say, I now know the hotel very well and can give travelers some insights. In short, I can recommend it and would go back there - I feel welcomed, rooms are comfortable, staff very friendly, hotel is very safe and clean. Nonetheless there are some deficits that the management needs to address.  Good: - Friendly staff, and clearly well-trained - Security - controlled access to the hotel grounds and security guards on each floor (feels like overkill perhaps, but certainly reassuring. - Fitness center - good gym, there are even aerobics classes etc if you are into that; well-to-do locals have memberships here - ""The Office"" bar + terrace on the 2nd floor - several nights a week they BBQ",October 2011,,,wrote a review Nov 2011,"Darmstadt, Germany","['761 contributions', '666 helpful votes']",40,[]

The guest service line usually doesn't get picked up the first time you call... :) They are still ironing out some some small technial issues... like the room i stayed in had very small A.C. water seaping on the sealing... But all in all... the stay here is usually pleasant and relaxing. WiFi is free in the Lobby...

Finally something that is affordable and good service,"Trying to find a decent hotel to stay in, during a business trip, in Lagos, that doesn't send your company in the ""red"" is difficult. I think I finally found one, the Four Points by Sheraton is definitively the place to be at. The prices are on par with other international destinations, perhaps the food a little on the expensive side, but for the rest well priced. Nice staff, friendly and always smiling. Good facilities, clean and new. Will definitively return to stay here on my next trip to Lagos.",June 2011,,,wrote a review Jun 2011,"Cape Town Central, South Africa","['91 contributions', '39 helpful votes']",40,[]

Good happy hour in Adrenaline bar,"Really friendly and helpful staff. The Cafe in the reception lobby is a good alternative for a coffee/croissant breakfast if you don't want to pay full whack for full buffet breakfast - and the staff at Cafe Cappucino were really nice young people who made you feel welcome - they were great - as were the staff at the Adrenaline Bar - really friendly and helpful. The Happy hour is good and the bar is pretty good when the football is on at least. Internet was hit and miss, lifts a bit slow - but you have the view to look at from the lift .

Very satisfied customer,"I felt very safe at this hotel. There's a security guard on each floor. The personnel at the front desk were always smiling and ready to help me with questions and concerns I had. The room service was prompt and the food was good. The only problem I had was the air conditioner in my room was very noisy. I reported it once and someone came to check it out. It still wasn't fixed, but I didn't pursue the issue. I'm sure if I had they would have fixed it. The atmosphere was tranquil and beautiful. Over all, I would go back. And I recommend it to other travellers.",April 2011,,,wrote a review May 2011,"San Antonio, Texas","['2 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",50,[]
Good Choice For Victoria Island,I am currently resident at the Four Points. Some observations to date on my stay :-  Positives : Clean Rooms Reliable Reserve Power Supply for when Power Cuts happen (often in Lagos generally) Good Security Recognised Platinum Status on SPG and gave good upgrade Staff Generally friendly and helpful Nice Gym and reasonable looking pool Good speed free internet Good buffet theme nights mid week in main restaurant  Negatives: Hotel doesn't take Amex (incredible in these modern times for a chain like Starwood) Queue's at reception can be quite slow - looks a little understaffed at peak times Food menu in room and the sport bar Adrenaline is very limited (especially in Adrenaline which is a shame) The is a very pricey hotel - as is everywhere in Lagos it seems.

Unbelievable value,"Excellent value by Nigerian standards--by that I mean:  hotels in Lagos tend to be expensive;  this one was good value and the service was equal or better than what I'm accustomed to in the States or Europe.  There's not much to see or do in Lagos so I was stuck in the hotel most of the time, and I didn't end up feeling antsy.

Wonderful Room. Dirty Restaurant.,"Wonderful large room, nicely furnished. Fast internet connection. Large bath. On site restaurant is lacking. I found it full of dirty tables and was even seated at a table with dirty linens and so I moved after being seated once I found a table with a clean enough table linen. The buffet served is not well maintained.  I will not go back to the restaurant, however, I will stay at the hotel again because of the wonderful room. Bell service is lacking. I had to go back down and get my own luggage at check in because they were not prompt in getting it up to my room. Good security everywhere.

Not what i expected.....,"I stayed at this hotel early march and I have to say that my visit from the beginning to end was not pleasant. I have stayed at many sheraton hotels and I had hoped that the standard would be the same regardless of the country......well, I was wrong. First, the sales associate I spoke to before my arrival never reserved my room, so after 19 hours of flying I arrived at the hotel with no reservation. It took about 45 mins to an hour to finally have a reservation and to get checked in.  On a positive note, I have to say that their housekeeping is amazing- the room was always up to par every night (Although, I would suggest leaving more than 2 bath towels in the room).  I came back to the hotel for my last 3 nights (hoping that my experience could be different).

La Vida Lagos,"I usually stay at the Southern Sun on Ikoyi when I'm in Lagos, but its safe to say that the bar just got raised with the arrival of Four Points.  Yeah, its got some teething problems, but none that won't be sorted out as the year progresses. Everyone's there to help, the room's are spacious, beds comfy, food nice and they've got a great pool. Plus everything works when the power's on (apart from my safe!).   You really can't go wrong and I recommend it to all.

Giving My Wife Aniversary Treat,"Having stayed at the Four Point Sheraton Lagos before and fell in love with it, I decided to bring my wife along to experience the Hotel as a treat on our Wedding anniversary. She has since not stopped talking about the hotel and how she would love to go back there. So, I now have to take herand out two kids back to the hotel for the Easter holidays.  She liked the room decor, the lobby ambiance and the excellent service. The staff were very friendly. During diner at the restaurant, she noted that the feel was very personal and would love to revisit. Unfortunately, we did not have breakfast because our flight out was at 8AM and we had to leave the hotel at 6:30 to catch the flight in Ikeja. She is really looking forward to revisiting the hotel and this time, staying a bit longer",February 2011,,,wrote a review Mar 2011,"Abuja, Nigeria","['7 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",50,[]
Good by Lagos Standards.,"Hotels are very expensive at Lagos and as of now the choice is very limited if you are looking at 4/5 Star accommodation. There's the Southern Sun Ikoyi (earlier known as Sofitel Moorhouse Ikoyi) in Ikoyi/Victoria Island Area and the other Sheraton near the Airport. And that's it. Two other hotels are coming up... The Oriental is almost opposite this Four Points and expected to open shortly and ditto for the Radisson Blue in Victoria Island. Given that limited choice, I would rate the Four Points as the second best 4/5 Star accommodation at Lagos after the Southern Sun Ikoyi.  Service is very friendly and sincere but slow. Actually it is a little more complicated than that. Room Service and Housekeeping is prompt and efficient. Front desk is friendly and helpful but slow.",February 2011,,,wrote a review Mar 2011,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India","['583 contributions', '290 helpful votes']",40,[]
A Home away from Home,"Visiting from London I stayed at the recently opened 4 Points By Sheraton, Lagos in February & I was impressed by the restaurants, and the range of bars on site.   The level of cleanliness was of a high standard & the service was pretty impeccable throughout the hotel.  The hotel has definitely hit the ground running & its set a new standard in the arena of hospitality in Nigeria.  It will remain my hotel of choice for future visits & I look forward to returning in the near future.",February 2011,,,wrote a review Mar 2011,"London, United Kingdom","['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]

"Good for leisure, bad for business travel.","Everyone has their opinion so this is mine:  Good for leisure, bad for business travellers. Tried them as I saw the reviews and heard they recently opened.  Service is generally not good my opinion and experience and I've stayed everywhere in Lagos except for the Federal Palace.  Most things seem an effort for staff and dont go the extra mile.  (feels like they dont want to be there???) Food is boring and bland.  My biggest bugbear about this hotel is that EVERYTHING is slow! Found it amusing that the business centre doesnt print or bind documents, but has two laptops to check email....whoohoo. The major plus is the gym, spa and pool - hence the leisure comment. Location is not great except if you want to meet with Diamond Bank or Mobil. Traffic is manic around the hotel - which",February 2011,,,wrote a review Feb 2011,"London, United Kingdom","['3 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",30,[]

Best stay in Lagos!,"I have spent several months in Lagos hotels and have to say that the Four Points is by far the best hotel in Lagos. Rooms are brand new, nicely furnished and very clean. There is a choice of good quality restaurants and bars in the hotel and the best Spa and Gym I have seen in Nigeria. The single best thing about the Four Points is its super-friendly and helpful Staff, that make every stay memorable. Compared to European hotels, the price is rather high. But in comparison to the competition in Lagos prices are in line, and you definitely get the highest value for your Naira here.",January 2011,,,wrote a review Jan 2011,"Zurich, Switzerland","['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
Best Hotel in Lagos,"We stayed for a weekend at the hotel and we were very much impressed by this brand new property. The interior is very modern and bright and the rooms and bathrooms are spacious and beautiful designed. All the staff members are very well trained and were all extremely friendly and helpful during our stay. The atmosphere in the restaurant was great and food was excellent.

Pretty good for Lagos,"I‚Äôd be surprised if you get better than this in Lagos  CHECKIN & LOBBY: well-staffed, modern, 4/5 star hotel style. Typical western standard ‚Äì only small detail and it‚Äôs a bit strange is that they do not accept Amex! Lobby is bright, clean with lots of places to sit. There is a coffee dock. The sports bar (not bad at all), pool (nice but a bit cold) are accessible from here.  ROOM & BATHROOM: Nice! Lots of lights, pillows, very clean, nice bathroom etc. Nothing negative to say. Strange thing was one curtain was missing but when I called they got this sorted out.   LOCATION: Watch out where you‚Äôre based in Lagos ‚Äì it‚Äôs quite vast and if you‚Äôre far from where you need to go you could be looking at hours spent in traffic.

Simpy sensational,"The is the best hotel I have ever stayed in in Nigeria. The staff is wonderful. I was taking my kids to Nigeria for the first time and they loved the selection of Nigerian dishes at the main restaurant, which also doubles as a french restaurant, in the hotel.  The hotel has a car hire service for $100 dollars a day including the driver. Our driver, Peter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The only thing the Eko Suites, Federal Palace Hotel and Hilton have over this hotel is they are situated in larger compounds. I would recommend this hotel over them any day though.",January 2011,,,wrote a review Jan 2011,"Hartford, Connecticut","['1 contribution', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]

Great Way of Life In Lagos,"I had been looking forward to experiencing the Four Points hospitality in Nigeria and kept monitoring the SPG website. Once it opened its doors and I had a meeting in Lagos, I immediately jumped at the idea of staying in the hotel and must say, I WAS VERY IMPRESSED.  The hotel met every international standard and more. Very clean, extremely friendly staff, nice rooms and very comfortable bed that makes you not want to get up in the morning. The food is excellent and the layout of the restaurant is beautiful.  Cost is rather on the high side, but for that standard and compared with other hotels in Nigeria, it is the most reasonable of them all.  Compared to other Four Points Sheratons, I would score this one 95% and recommend it highly to visitors to Lagos.",November 2010,,,wrote a review Nov 2010,"Abuja, Nigeria","['7 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",50,[]
