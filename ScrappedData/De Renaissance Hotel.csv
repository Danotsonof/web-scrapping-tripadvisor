Great brunch,Stayed one night only en route Uk. Staff could benefit from more training. Newish hotel.  Rooms were fine but did not get adequate toiletries. Part of the toiletries had been used by previous guest and not checked. Exec lounge had suya (African barbecued chilli meat strips) which was great and the staff there were attentive. They had a nice but small pool   Which too me was probably too small to swim in.,January 2018,Traveled with family,,wrote a review May 2018,"London, United Kingdom","['388 contributions', '74 helpful votes']",20,[]
Worst place since years,"Location is good, few meters from the shopping malls, check in and doorbell staff is good, the rest is miserable. You can sit at the restaurant for hrs just waiting for someone to decide to bring you a menu and disappear. Avoid the restaurant unless you wish to spend a considerable amount of time waiting. Rooms are spacious and not very clean. Some of them install old wall AC with no remote control or thermostat.",December 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"Cape Town, South Africa","['181 contributions', '74 helpful votes']",10,[]
An embarrassment to the hospitality industry in Lagos,"This hotel could be a remarkable place to stay (due to its location) but at the current state due to our experience I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone as it is quite an embarrassment to the hospitality industry with very poor customer service even from the hotel manager (Sumil or Kumil) cannot remember his name.   We wouldn’t have been able to stay more than one night at the hotel due to the exceptionally poor service we received and when brought to the attention of the manager, his handling of the situation was below expectation.   When asked why the key to the Safe from another room could also unlock the safe in our room (as  we observed due to checking into 2 rooms in our case), there was no credible explanation.

Second stay here this year,"Location is Prime. Without that, nothing spectacular. From the outside, beautiful. Lobby, beautiful. But--Rock hard mattress. Killed my back. Shower large, so thats a plus. However; they don't even have free coffee in the room. Raspberry tea and hot chocolate. My husband went down for cream for MY coffee that I just happened to have with me. They said they were sending room service. They brought everything except cream. We stayed in a mini suite with a small noisy air conditioner. Couldn't enjoy a swim in the pool for all the partying. Bongs everywhere. Aparantly a private party with very loud music. Ok.....but my hotel that was $30 cheaper a night had a great pool and free coffee __ creamer included....

Excellent location does not make up for the poor service,"I am staying here right now and will be looking for another place to stay. Sure the location is good (right next to Ikeja mall) but that is not worth it. The service has been terrible.  1) This is a basic hospitality feature, but every hotel in a developing country should have free bottled water in the room. There was none when I arrived in the room.  2) I'm still waiting for my room service dinner that I ordered TWO hours ago. Absolutely unacceptable.  3) When I ordered an item, the staff said he wasn't familiar with the new menu. A new menu is no excuse for you not to know it. When you make a new menu, it is your job to make sure every staff member knows the menu! 4) They have just continental breakfast (toast, coffee and fruits).

"Rude, unprofessional staff. Rooms were sub-par, event hall was disappointing","We booked their large Banquet room, and a bedroom for one day and what a disappointing situation it was. In typical Nigerian style, they changed price on you. Firstly, I have to say that MARIS, their hotel manager was absolutely unprofessional. She ignores emails, and on day of the event, she claimed that we agreed on paying an additional 40k just for cleaning. We had 20 staff there to do cleaning and had never agreed with this unprofessional woman to pay 40k. Secondly, one of our Directors kept demanding that they do the right thing, when he went out to ask for desks they had promised to deliver, Maris made a very racist comment and said ""That White man complains too much"".

Just there.,"I spent 2 nights at Renaissance hotel between Aug 17th and 18th 2016, having a lot of expectations.  The hotel is next door to a shopping Mall and a walking distance to the seat of government. The room could have been better finished, with rough edges and noticeable poorly mounted doors. I was surprise to find out there were no complimentary tea or coffee in the room . The hotel is about 30 minutes to the International airport, just average.

NICE HOTEL,"De Renaissance Hotel is a very good hotel with a very nice location.   The hotel is about 13 minute drive to the local airport if you want to travel within Nigeria, and about 18 minutes drive to the international airport on a traffic free day, but can take hours to the airport, If you are booking or staying here you have to be conscious of your time.  The hotel is close to the sit of Lagos State government, close to Ikeja Shopping Mall (Shopprite).  Its a beautiful piece with a very spacious rooms and clean environment, but the front desk staff are not professional enough, i advice the management engage more qualified personnel at the front Desk.

Nothing fantastic,Spent a night at the hotel with friends a night to my wedding. There was nothing fantastic about the hotel which is quite surprising considering its location. We went to the mall next door to get food and we asked for disposable cutlery but we were told it's the hotel's policy not to give out cutlery. Had issues with the water heater and we never really got hot water and the lady at the reception gave an attitude when I called about this.

"all very friendly, but not well managed","This hotel is excellently located, being only a short walk from the Ikeja City Mall, where Rhapsody’s is to be recommended for surf and turf and good draft beer. The rooms are clean and the beds comfortable. And the club sandwich in the bar is fine.  The first time I stayed here I had to share a room with a colleague because “there is a problem with your reservation” made for two rooms several weeks in advance, paid for in advance by our Nigerian office and checked on each of the three days before we arrived. No dramas, but not a great start and, much in the style of most hotels in Lagos, no apology or recovery offer.  Having now stayed here three times, it is clear that all rooms have noisy ACs.

I found this place by accident and frustration after my $200 per night hotel turned out to be the usual dump. Got there and saw a $350 rack rate. Was ready to walk out when to my surprise the clerk was willing to seriously negotiate. I was able to get a first class room for $175 per night for the three night.
