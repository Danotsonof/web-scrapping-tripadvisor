Always Great,"This is my second stay at Presken Hotel Maryland, located inside Shonibare Estate. It's a nice place to chill. The ambience is cool and nice. It is quiet, although the pool area expectedly is loud with music. Friendly staff, food is okay and there's 24hr light.",October 2021,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Dec 2021,"Lagos State, Nigeria","['647 contributions', '86 helpful votes']",40,[]
