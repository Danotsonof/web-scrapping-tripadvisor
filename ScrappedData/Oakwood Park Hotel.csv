"An average, secure and comfortable hotel....","Was on business in Lagos, Nigeria...though there are much better internationally known hotels in Lagos, this hotel was close to the business venue and traffic being what it is in Lagos it was practical to choose the Oakwood. There is security at the gated entrance and in and around the Hotel 24/7. The reception on arrival was pleasant enough nice staff and a hassle free check-in. The room was comfortable but lighting was dim, especially in the bathroom, the room had the normal amenities, coffee & tea facility, Laundry, international TV channels and free Wi-Fi.  The Oakwood has a nice Bar/lounge area and dining room, however, where it all starts to fall apart is the standard of food choice and service, staff in the dinning room are not well trained and slow to respond to any",August 2018,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2018,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","['132 contributions', '115 helpful votes']",30,"['Rooms bubble_30', 'Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_20']"

Damp damp damp,This hotel is damp all my things including suite case & shoes were damp. Just could sleep cos of the stench as a result of dampness. I discussed this with the reception and they offered another room with a promise to look into my complaint. I will give it a second try to be able to make up my mind if I will ever stay in this hotel.

Good hotel on Victoria island,I stayed here for a few days and was impressed by the accommodation available and provided. The hotel has a lot of paved parking. This allows access to a good lobby area. The hotel is clean and staff are helpful. The room I had was good and very comfortable. Only slight concern was the mattress I had sank in the middle but was ok. If I had stayed longer I would have asked for a replacement which I am sure I would have got without any problems.  Conference facilities were good and to international standards.  Food was very good and catered for local and international tastes.  I would go back to this hotel if I had the choice.,March 2018,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2018,"Welwyn, United Kingdom","['35 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",30,[]
A decent spot!,"Oakwood Park is a Protea hotel well-located along Lekki expressway;the environment is calm and well maintained.  The jewel of this facility is its library-themed restaurant which gives an old English feel; as for the food, well, it is decent.   The rooms are well ventilated and cleaned daily while the pool side can serve as an evening dining spot.

Faded star,"I have dined at this hotel for many years, and I simply love the decor, at least that was when it was part of the Protea chain. So when our annual retreat was scheduled to hold here, it was a delight, or so I thought.  The hotel still retains its boutique look, but it was evident it has fallen on hard times. The carpeting has become squalid; the staff looked scraggy, and the atmosphere was somber.   The have tried to keep things going, but the efforts weren't enough.  Coming to the rooms, the walls have water stains, the AC didn't control the temperature accurately, so things were always humidly cold; like a bad winter morning in Europe. The ceilings were dirty, water from the faucets slightly colored.  However, the friendliness of the staff was still world-class, and the",January 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jan 2017,Bonanjo,"['55 contributions', '44 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_20', 'Service bubble_40']"
Good accomodation,"This hotel is located on the Lekki expressway and is easily accessible by Car. It has all the necessary amenities and the rooms are large and spacious. mixed experience with staff as most of them are very helpful however upon checkout the staff were very unaccommodating to my request to print my boarding pass.

Home from home,"This, former Protea, is a peaceful hotel on the Lekki Epe (pronounced 'Ekpeh') expressway. The lounge and diner/ restaurant has an old library feel to it as they've used real encyclopaedias to enhance the aesthetics. Rooms are clean with proper air conditioning, good fast Wifi, beds comfy. There is a mini gym, outdoor swimming pool(not very well maintained though!), and ample space for parking. I bumped into quite a few 'expatriates' who looked relaxed and welcomed. Breakfast avails you an array of choices. Members of staff are very courteous and ever willing to help. The front door is manned 24 hrs with a concierge service, so is the front gate. You feel safe I paid a rate that included breakfast for one that approximated Â£85. Breakfast for an additional guest is N5000 (~Â£10).",July 2016,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Jul 2016,"Wilmslow, United Kingdom","['88 contributions', '39 helpful votes']",40,[]

Home away from home,I live in the UK and recently visited Family in Lagos. I was let down by another hotel due to very poor quality and had to check out prematurely. So I went on a hotel hunt and stumbled upon this gem situated on Lekki express way.

Lekki Location,"Due to shutdown of the Radisson we had to look for alternative accommodation. Tried the 4 points but way too expensive. Took a chance at Oakwood and got a great response. Good value. Rooms just recently refurbished, great wifi (Free if you stay) and breakfast included in the room rate.

Nice to be back,"For me, this is more home away from home. I have stayed here on and off for the past 10 years. Recent refurbishments makes this a lovely hotel. When I got into the shower after a long trip, it was a lovely strong massaging shower.   The staff are friendly, rooms comfortable and food is nice too.

Good and friendly hotel but expensive,"For some business I had to stay 4 days in this hotel, the staff is friendly, and the rooms are ok, not that special, but it is cleaned good. The food (buffet ) is with a lot of food to choose from( Sunday with live music ) good food.  The gym is not completely up to date, the equipment can use some attention, bicycle saddle and the running machine but you can do some work out.  The prices are expensive, for 1.5 liter water at the bar I pay 4,3 dollar, but than again it is Nigeria.",August 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,Lagos,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",40,[]
Not worthy of the Protea name,"Having utilized the Protea brand severally including the one in Benin city, I booked this hotel in a hurry and I was disappointed. The restaurant and customer service was good. However, accommodation was horrible. My room had a horrid damp smell and the bathroom had weird stains between the tiles. The bed and sheets were also far from being comforting.

Below Expectations,"With the Protea name behind it, I expected a lot more from this hotel. My room (219) had a damp smell, was poorly equipped and AC wasn't working. No hotel directory or menu or any form of info in the room. The drainage in the bathroom was not flowing properly. Good WiFi everywhere in the hotel except in my room where it was non existent. You also have to keep logging in to connect via WiFi and it only allows one device at a time. Great chicken/chips, nice bar and music.

Excellent Service,"Recently stayed at Protea Hotel, Oakwood Park for a conference and I was pleasantly surprised by the service and friendliness of the staff.  They were very welcoming and helpful on my arrival.  Rooms were clean and comfortable. Aircon worked wonderfully well in room and throughout the hotel.  Restaurant food was good and surprisingly spicy (if you don't like the buffet, you can also request al-la carte).   Conference facility was good and assistance from staff were brilliant.

Good for the area,"First of all, when reading this you have to keep in mind that offer is very limited in Nigeria and quality is not up to any standard I had been exposed to before. However, given the limitations, this hotel can be considered good. It is normally clean even though you can easily notice stains both on the walls and on the carpet. Staff is predominantly polite and helpful. Restaurant provides reasonable food with limited variety. Room are not spacious and AC really needs improvement. Internet access is intermitent and power outages occur 5 times in 2 days.",May 2013,,,wrote a review May 2013,"Katy, Texas","['425 contributions', '205 helpful votes']",30,[]

Protea newbie,"First time I have stayed at a Protea managed hotel. Overall very acceptable for the area. In Nigeria you have to forget the rackrate comparison against the star rating because all hotels charge a fortune due to the lack of quality available bedspace and the running costs are so high within the rest of Africa. You can only really assess on the time you spend at the place, the advertised services and the quality of the service provided. Remember price is not part of this review. The pool and bar/restaurant area is definitely the hotel's biggest thumbs up. It's a shame the clientele prefer to take room service virtually every time. The protea's chain management decision to remove room service charge is very detrimental to the ambience of the restaurant and also the shoe leather the",March 2013,,,wrote a review Apr 2013,"Island of Malta, Malta","['32 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",30,[]
Hotel with some hope,The Protea Hotel in Lekki serves mainly Oil and Gas workers. This hotel has seen better times which is evident from the shabby carpets but it does appear to be looking at improving the standard The manager listens to issues and addresses them instantly - generally the hotel is well run and clean. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are well fitted out with comfortable beds and bedding which is rare in the corner of the world. Meals are buffet. The buffet caters mainly for Nigerian foods but alternatives can be found on the a la carte menu. Food is generally of a good standard but the menu does not change much from day to day.  The cost to stay at the hotel is high - as are all hotels in Lagos. Not the kind of place to have a party if you have a budget.

Good Hotel,"Stayed for just the one night, Rooms were comfortable but in need of some minor repairs, Staff were helpful and accommodating  Meals were all buffett style with a reasonable selection, but  la' carte chooses would have been nice.  At breakfast omelets or fried eggs were available to order. my only quibble about the Resturant was the chair seats being narrow and thus making them uncomfortable. Cleanliness was good and the bar area was clean and comfortable.The reception , bar and restaurant theme is one of a huge library and very interesting. There were some nice touches such as the small bottle of complimentary wine and water.

First class,This was my first trip Lagos and what a great hotel!  The staff are so helpful and friendly and always attentive.  I have never really enjoyed such service anywhere else in the world.  From the door staff to the receptionists and the mangers to the waiters everyone had a smile and a welcoming word.  This level of customer service is credit to the team and the company.,February 2012,,,wrote a review Jan 2013,Cornwall,"['34 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,[]

Far better than expected,"Spent 2 nights here in April - It was first time in Nigeria and so I had some trepidation but have to say Oakwood Protea was absolutely first class!  Ok, it's not like a European 5* hotel but everything was clean, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and the manager was in the bar in the evening chatting to guests to make sure they were happy. Not a great location for centre of Lagos but otherwise totally reccomended.",April 2009,,,wrote a review Apr 2009,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom","['455 contributions', '36 helpful votes']",40,[]
"Best hotel in Lekki, nice rooms and staff","This is the best hotel in Lekki Island (Lagos) and is usually frequently by people who have business at the Chevron complex around the corner.  My room cost $300 per night - a bit steep by U.S. standards but the nearby competition is not even in the same league so it is hard to complain.  The rooms are about the same quality as a Holiday Inn or lowgrade Sheraton in the USA.  Fairly sizable, very firm king size beds, a nice desk and closet, and a 13"" vintage color TV that is about 20 years out of date (though thankfully with a good selection of cable channels).  The bathroom was small but deluxe by nigeria standards with a glass shower, good water pressure and a nice sink area.  The refrig came stocked with 2 water bottles per day (a necessity) and the in room safe will also",January 2009,,,wrote a review Jan 2009,"Danville, California","['2621 contributions', '135 helpful votes']",40,[]
At least close to Chevron,"Ok hotel, but nothing special given the price. The hotel was clean and surrounding guarded courtyard/parking area seemed safe enough. Nice enough bar and small pool area. That said smallish room with twin-size bed, AC that never quite cooled the room, front desk with an attitude, service in restaurant slow despite a lot of staff milling aimlessly about, buffet in restaurant (at $60) really the only choice of food besides lunch menu, internet access never available during my 2 week stay, and no place to exercise, all disappoint for a $300 hotel.
