Not impressive and got cheated on prices that were confirmed in writing by the hotel!!,"Stayed 6 nights at the hotel for attending a course. Good room, but the placement of the bed was just across the AC with no way to reduce the AC fan. Bathroom needed a bit of maintenance. All in all room was not bad, but the wifi was extremely poor. Had power failures a few times but the generator was switched on quite quickly. Restaurant was very poor, although the food was good it took about 2 hours to get your burger or salad. But once I found jam at the breakfast buffet that had expired over 15 months ago I was not sure what I was ordering and eating was even fresh or not. I did get stomach issues when I stayed there. The hotel overcharges for everything!!! a bottle of water costs 100 outside but 1000 in the hotel. Food is extremely overpriced and conversion rates are also",October 2023,Traveled on business,Do not rely on the gym.

Bit of a mixed bag,"The rooms are spacious and clean.  Several of the bathrooms require maintenance with either broken fittings or cracked tiles, panels etc. each room has very large pieces of art on display which vary from pleasing to downright scary depending on which room you get.  The restaurant is where things really go wrong.  Items not available, food preparation taking nearly two hours, food not being served at the same time for groups and the exorbitant pricing vs quality, all add to the disappointment.  The failure of the restaurant is really a pity as it detracts from what would otherwise be a 4 star rating.",July 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2023,"Lagos, Nigeria",['2 contributions'],30,[]
Quality of facility is fast waning.,"I'm currently here for three nights for a training. This facility has a lot of potentials and looks a lot like what I have seen in the Western world. However many parts of of it have been left without maintenance over the years. The gym has broken down equipment that have not been fixed over time. The wifi keeps throwing security errors, I had to make use of my personal wifi to be safe. My room kept making a beeping sound every 15 mins. Some of the staff act unprofessional and poorly trained. A little tweak here and there and they will back to 4 star.

"A bit of house, A bit of Hotel","The positive and the nagative aspects of the property can be attributed to its 'positioning'. They want to be called a hotel and a house. True to the name - the food, the interiors, the pool, the facilities were just like a house. Offering everything basic to feel like home or guesthouse. However, the charm of hotel was missing.

Dirty bathrooms;  service slower than an arthritic tortoise.,"We stayed here for one night as it was closer to the conference venue we were visiting the next night.  Initially our impressions were that it was a beautiful venue with a great pool and friendly staff.  This impression was quickly dispersed by waiting over an hour and a half for dinner.  We had called ahead to check that the kitchens were open and were extremely disappointed to have to wait for such a long time (we ate at 11.30).  The food when it did arrive was poor and that is a charitable description.    Rooms were tired,  The bathrooms in most of our groups' rooms were covered in black mould.

Average hotel,"The rooms in the hotel are medium sized, not very spacious but comfortable. I stayed in 3 rooms over the course of my staggered stay there. In each of these rooms, the bed mattress had sunk and was quite uncomfortable.   The bathrooms were pretty good and well maintained. The food on offer had quite a decent variety for vegetarians too. However, the breakfast was a huge disappointment. Virtually nothing good for vegetarians and hardly any variety. Service standards are okayish.

"Perfect and very clean, well secured Hotel in Lagos, Nigeria !","We recently spent a bit over one week in this hotel, I can say it was my best experience in an Lagos Hotel so far ( and IÂ´ve been  staying in many different hotels in Lagos in the last 15 years). The managment is really doing all they can, to make it a nice experience for any guest. The breakfast offers almost anything you like, from warm to cold food, there is nigerian food (for example rice, yam or plantane with different stews) for breakfast, but also the european type... you can choose from different croissants, bread,cake or cookies, marmelade, fresh fruit salad, vegetables, sausages, different sorts of eggs, baked beans, fruit juice and so much more.

Truly terrible food,This is a strange hotel tucked away in a residential estate. The rooms are ok and the people seemed nice if not overly attentive. The standout feature is the food for al the wrong reasons. Lagos used to be a city of legendary poor value in accommodation and especially famous for trademark blue eggs and generally horrible food. In recent years things have changed with some good quality new hotels moving the game on and it's now possible to have a world standard breakfast and a good dinner in Lagos. Just not at this place.Powder coffee and generally a total lack of fresh and tasty food makes this a throwback to the bad old days of Lagos where a stale roll was as good as it got.

Disappointing service!,"I came to stay a night before going to the US embassy for my Visa interview. I planned the leave the hotel by 05.30 am to beat the traffic and instructed the staff 3 times to provide my breakfast and lunch as take-away by 5.15 a.m. which was assured by all three of them. Surprisingly even till 05.40 a.m. no one turned-up and it's only I went down by 05.40 a.m. they started preparing it. For my shock, they brought my breakfast as a take-away  along with a glass of milk wrapped in a polythene for me to take away.  Also when I went to check-out I noted that no one has informed the front desk that i'm checking out, so wasted another 5 minutes there.

The People Make The Experience,"Seldom do I get to try all of the elements of a hotel - health club, pool , restaurant , and bar ( in this case)  . As luck and the vagaries of travel in Lagos would have it, I had a chance to use all of the facilities of the Elion House a couple of times.   The result: the  facilities were all quite satisfying and made for a comfortable and relaxed place to stay (and hang out).  The room was clean and spacious.  The hot pepper soup with goat at the restaurant was delicious and the breakfasts in the bistro were quite good. The health club lacked for nothing in terms of work out options (pleasantly cooled in a hot hot place) and the pool was pleasant and well kept.

Not bad at all,"My stay @ Elion house was just two nights to celebrate the valentines day.  Very warm staff I must stay, the hotel was full to capacity but that's understandable considering the time of year.  Food portion was meagre, buffet breakfast wasnt so much of a buffet,  very limited. Pool looked small but actually has a massive deep end. I think that was okay....

The only thing keeping it from earning an excellent rating is the very frequent power outages. The room was excellent, the service was great (though the rather abrupt style of communication of the Nigerians can be somewhat disconcerting), the 24 hour (!) room service was prompt and so was the laundry, and the food a bit pricey but excellent quality and quite a few choices from around the world.

8 days in Elion House,"Stayed at Elion House for 8 days. Location: Lagos is a city of corrugated iron shacks mainly. This is not a disrespectful statement, but it is the truth - go and check if you do not believe me. Elion is in an area called Dolphin extension. It is in a compound, and the compound is on par with the poorer residential areas in any western country. Elion is owned by a Lebanese man who was born in Nigeria. Service; The staff are the most polite that I have encountered in all my travels. Room service average wait time is close to an hour. The hotel will sell you Naira currency for for N120 to the US dollar. Room pricing: most hotels in Lagos are more pricey than London, New York or Paris.

Although often billed as a 5 star, it would probably only get a 3 start rating in Europe or the US. At around 270USD a night for the most basic room, it really is frightfully expensive and I did not get the impression at any time that it was good value for money. That said, the room (room 311) was clean ( albeit with a badly tiled shower and a shower curtain pole that kept falling down) and it had a safe and satellite tv.
