A never-to-return-to place. Proceed at your peril!,"Airport transfer and breakfast were not included, despite being indicated as so. The linen was filthy. And just when you thought it couldn't get worse, there was no running water, and one would have had to take a bath from filthy bucket! TV had few channels and a very grainy picture. A truly horrible experience! When I queried the lack of airport transfers and breakfast, the person I spoke to claimed they had asked to have this removed in vain. It's the first time I've been disappointed by an online booking. Hopefully, the last. I have no intention of returning to Maria Suites.",August 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Sep 2017,"Texcoco, Mexico","['21 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",10,"['Cleanliness bubble_10', 'Service bubble_10', 'Sleep Quality bubble_10']"
