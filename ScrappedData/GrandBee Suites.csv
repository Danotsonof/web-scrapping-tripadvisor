Horrible toilet,I stayed at this hotel for few hours. Free wifi  but very slow. Clean room  and very big. Poor maintenance of the toilet. Door handle is missing and the tap is broken. I enjoyed my dinner and quite environment. Little car park.,July 2020,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jul 2020,"Atlanta, Georgia","['307 contributions', '25 helpful votes']",20,[]
Not a bad hotel!,"I booked at the last minute for a few days in this hotel.  I had reservations based on previous reviews but kept an open mind.  The location was quite good in Ikeja and transport links were also good.  Check-in was efficient.  The room was clean and the aircon was effective. There is a safe for your valuables.  Unfortunately there was no bathrobe as advertised when I booked.  The minibar was also empty!!  There was an issue with a socket that I pointed out to housekeeping but unfortunately was not fixed during my stay.  Meals were very tasty and a lot!!!  Staff at the restaurant were very polite and helpful.    Check out was also good.  The good parts outweigh the bad and as long as you have an open mind and get a good deal, not a bad place to be.",December 2019,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Dec 2019,"London, United Kingdom","['211 contributions', '14 helpful votes']",30,[]
