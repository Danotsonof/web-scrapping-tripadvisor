Terrible Terrible,"Whatever you do, avoid this place. You would be more comfortable sleeping in your car. Smells like sh*t..... Lots and lots of mosquitoes and dishonest dront desk staff... avoid the place if you can for your own good!",January 2020,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jan 2020,,"['2 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",10,[]
Very Good Staff,"The staff of the hotel are very hospitable, neat and very friendly. I advise any body lodging around Victoria Island to patronize Virgin Rose Resort. Their swimming pool is very okay and their elevator is working perfect unlike some hotels around that axis.",April 2019,Traveled on business,Standard rooms,wrote a review Apr 2019,"Badagry, Nigeria","['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
A little gem for the foodie,I had the best cream of chicken soup at the restaurant on site. The service was friendly and very good. The hotel staff is good in what they do and pay attention to detail. They are knowledgable and can answer all questions with ease.   The room I received was not a bit outdated but all things worked well and it was very comfortable. Clean and tidy.  Wi-fi is excellent   The room I had did not have a view.,October 2018,Traveled on business,"ask to see different options, so you can choose one that fits your needs.",wrote a review Oct 2018,"Cape Town, South Africa","['116 contributions', '18 helpful votes']",40,"['Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"

"Amazing service, quality rooms, great breakfast, wonderful and Service with a smile","This hotel and the quality of service and the amenities was perfect. The staff were friendly and the food at the breakfast was superb. The room is beautiful and well-equipped. When I forgot my card-key and needed to ask for my room number at the desk, the front desk clerk asked me some security questions before giving me a new key card for my room. This was a great hotel at a great price.Upkeep was perfect at this hotel, it looked brand new. The bed was comfortable. it was perfect. It was a quiet hotel and we slept great! The continental breakfast was also very good. We found the front desk to be friendly and helpful as well. The Management and staff definitely went out of their way to make this a pleasant stay for us. Looking forward to coming back to this hotel......a home",June 2017,Traveled on business,The room with a round bed,wrote a review Jul 2017,"Lagos State, Nigeria","['3 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50']"
This should not be called a resort,"Besides having paints peeling off the walls on the corridor, service was way too slow. I ordered a bottle of wine and it took them 40mins to deliver it. I was beginning to wonder if they went to pick the grapes themselves.   The waiter who attended to me was quite friendly. When I asked for food, he said the quickest I would get would be chicken and chips. He ended up making it himself as he saw that I was very hungry and not about to wait for hours for food.  Loved the meal! The chicken was fried just right!   Did I mention that the bed was so hard?! I didn't pay that much to suffer!",December 2016,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Dec 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['341 contributions', '443 helpful votes']",20,"['Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_20', 'Sleep Quality bubble_20']"
Fantastic Fish Barbecue,My friend and I are went for dinner. We ordered Grilled Fish. They offered extra large grilled fish. Massive fish. I must tell you that this is the best Seafood I tried in Lagos. Tasty food.   Restaurant ambience could be better. The guy who served was Bobby excellent guy. I will visit again for sure to try different varieties. I never stayed in that hotel. I am giving my review for the restaurant.,December 2016,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Dec 2016,"Lagos, Nigeria","['12 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,[]
Basic but Adequate,"African style hotel with friendly staff. My room was spacious with lounge area. Free wifi. Generous hot water. Fridge not working. Room missing some items on arrival. Staff worked hard to give a good experience but hotel is ""tired"" and would benefit for basic maintenance. My bathroom was recently refurbished but unfinished which let it down. Quiet so sleep quality good. Large bed with the hardest mattress ever known! Breakfast choice minimal and African with instant coffee. TV only 4 channels. Totally not smoking which is welcomed. Pool looked ok but surround was poorly maintained. Rooms air-conditioned.",July 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2016,"Salisbury, United Kingdom","['976 contributions', '190 helpful votes']",20,"['Value bubble_30', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_40']"
Average but friendly hotel,Stayed here for a few nights in early November 2015. I think it was a slow weekend so the manager offered us a very good discount. The hotel is okay but has suffered a bit of wear and tear. There was also this lingering unpleasant canal smell. The great thing about this hotel is the overwhelming friendly staff. They were so attentive to all our needs. Food at the restaurant was also delicious and well priced for Lagos Island. There is also a spa there but I didn't get round to trying it. This hotel is a great alternative for guests on business/leisure trip on the Island but are on a budget because of it's location.,November 2015,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Dec 2015,,"['10 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",30,[]
