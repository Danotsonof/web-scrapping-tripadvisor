Worst and Regretful experience of Stay here GLEE was not so much Glee ata all,"This Hotel for the Price did not match any expectations at all , The restaurant and rooms very small , it didn't meet any standards , though I had booked for 7 days of  stay , i checked out the very next day , as they didn't have any Vegetarian food options at all , they were amused & surprised at asking for Vegetarian food",October 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Today,"Bengaluru, India",['4 contributions'],10,"['Value bubble_10', 'Location bubble_10', 'Service bubble_10']"
STAY AT THE GLEE HOTEL,"Initially, I was going to write the place off. There was an unnecessary delay in check in, the POS Machine was in use somewhere else within the hotel. I had to wait about 12 minutes, for payment and check in. The front desk staff was very Polite, but I had to struggle with my 3 suitcases upstairs, as there was no porter to assist. The same thing happened while checking out after 2 nights stay.  The breakfast was for only 1 person, I had to pay for my partner each morning, this ought to have been stated. The room was neat, and breakfast was great.  I would not mind going back there, and would recommend it.

"Amazing Hotel!!! Thank you, Glee!!!","Five stars all around! We stayed in Glee for two weeks in May. Glee hotel was everything I expected and more. If you are looking for a place on the Lagos Island that is close to everything, such as, a great location for nightlife, shopping, relaxation, and that is also on a not so busy street, stay at the Glee. The hotel is very safe, and they have high security for anyone entering and exiting the building, this gave me such a relief! Booking a taxi out of the hotel was an exceptionally smooth process. The hotel location is excellent as it is just 5-10 minutes walking/Uber distance to main attractions in Lagos, which are the party scene, shopping mall and many nearby restaurants, it was perfect. The food was of great quality as well! I stayed for 13 nights and got to know the",May 2021,,,wrote a review Jun 2021,,"['8 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Solo Rendezvous!!,"I came here to spend a night in readiness for an important examination. Although there was a little snag at the reception, i eventually had a good stay in the short time. Hotels needs some maintenance around the swimming area and some of the room facilities like the shower which didn't have a lot of pressure. Dinner of fish and chips was thoroughly enjoyed...",February 2021,,The rooms are close to each other and are not entirely sound proof.

"Awesome, Interesting, Lovely and Beautiful Hotel","This Hotel is one of the best in the heart of Victoria Island. Good Food quality, pleasant staff, serene environment, top notch room, good ambiance, all these and more is what i will qualify the hotel. My first visit and I was hooked. The staff are pleasant, the food is good, the rooms too is so cool. It is indeed a home away from home. I will lodge in the hotel again and again and I will always tell my friends and family members about it too. Wonderful place to be.",February 2020,,,wrote a review Feb 2020,,['4 contributions'],50,[]
DONT STAY HERE!!,Me and my partner stayed here for one week because Eko hotel was fully booked this week as we previously stayed there for two weeks. I want to say we are not wealthy by the way and Eko hotel was slightly expensive but I can say to you just pay the extra money and go there because this place is an utter joke and what weâ€™ve experienced from the staff there was pure racism and rudeness. I booked the hotel on booking.com and emailed the hotel with several questions in regards to security and power cuts only to be completely ignored. I booked the room and was emailed the details of the room and was told I would get a room with a balcony and pictures sent was showed a nice room with luxuries. DONT LET THESE PICTURES FOOL YOU!!! We was given a room without a balcony and when questioned,December 2019,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Dec 2019,"London, United Kingdom","['18 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",10,[]

Does what you need- reliably and with love!,"I wouldnâ€™t call it the nicest place, or the biggest room....but when I needed a place to stay nearby the hospital when my husband had emergency surgery, the staff at this small hotel became my family. I felt safe and looked after. Use it if you need a cheap place on VI!",March 2019,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Mar 2019,,"['29 contributions', '35 helpful votes']",40,[]
