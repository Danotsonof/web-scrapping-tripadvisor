Poor Service,"The Hotel is badly run by untrained staff and nonchalant management. The service is so poor, food is so no, no, no and the staff need training on hospitality management.   To imagine this hotel is located on high brow Ikoyi beats my imagination.",October 2015,Traveled on business,,wrote a review May 2016,"Lagos State, Nigeria","['50 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",20,"['Value bubble_20', 'Service bubble_20', 'Sleep Quality bubble_20']"
Definitely not worth the money-Terrible Value Poor Staff,"Stuck in Lagos  in the dark, I decided to stay overnight in Ikoyi rather than risk a night drive over to my normal Ikeja Hotel closer to the International Airport to depart Nigeria the next day. I still cannot believe how some Nigerian Hotels  (and The Ambassadors is a typical example) can charge 175USD/ 100 UKP a night for a poor service and low standard of Accomodation that would not meet one star standard anywhere else in the world. I arrived in the dark and was immediately directed to the hotel annex down the road. On checking in I decided to have a drink outside in the the thatched bar area, only to find the fhat the outside bar did not have any drinks and the large standing fans to keep cool and drive away mosquitoes were not working- Infact  one fan did not even have any",March 2010,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Mar 2010,Hereford UK,"['127 contributions', '109 helpful votes']",10,"['Value bubble_10', 'Rooms bubble_10', 'Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_10', 'Sleep Quality bubble_10']"
