Avoid - Like an Ibis but without the “charm”,"Quite possibly the worst run hotel in the whole of Nigeria! Staff who have not a single idea on customer service and have an uncanny ability to make you feel incredibly unwelcome at every turn!   Reception staff have zero idea of any kind of customer service principles. From being unable to find a booking on Expedia to shouting across reception to castigating for not being sat in exactly the right spot when having a beer in an empty lobby! The attitude is very much that customers are a pain in that means they actually have to do some work!  Breakfast is a joke affair with 5 lukewarm dishes, poor coffee and staff playing on phone rather than any attempt to serve you!   The only plus point is the bed is comfortable and shower was hot with power. Rooms are very small but ok.
