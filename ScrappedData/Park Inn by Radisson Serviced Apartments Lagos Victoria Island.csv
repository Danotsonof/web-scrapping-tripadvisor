Nice Christmas Stay in Lagos,"The hotel is well located and in a safe environment. We could walk without stress and had most lovely places we wanted to visit close by. The reception staff are wonderful as well as the bar. I found a lovely lady who tried her best to help at the restaurant during the breakfast. I did not really enjoy the breakfast as it did not give choices and as a result of that I did not really eat at the hotel. But I was wonderfully and highly surprised as well as my family when we tried the restaurant's dishes the night before our departure. It was greatly delicious and best value for money. We could rate 10/10 for the food. We got two rooms upgraded and they are wonderful.

Poor restaurant service,"I stayed for about 10 days and the general service is not bad however, the restaurant service is especially poor, the staff are rude and off putting and it always seems like they are standing over your shoulder and will willfully ignore you when it serves their agenda (Sulaimon and Oni are especially rude and off putting)  They have a revolving door or rules, dos and don‚Äôt that are inconsistent and impossible to understand, they willfully lie about the availability of certain services.

Comment on Stay on Park Inn by Radisson Serviced Apartments V. I.,"The room facilities need urgent upgrade. The toilet on the first room signed to me (main block) did not flush.

The hot-water shower in one of the two newly-renovated rooms (again assigned to me in the main block did not work. The wall by th head of the head of the bed dripped water, and the room had odour.

Great hotel. Great service,"After a very long journey from Benin City to Lagos and the Park inn we were greeted by friendly reception staff. As I had contacted the hotel prior our arrival Rita the general manager greeted us. As we had to go road instead of air we were given a complementary drink and upgraded to a deluxe suite. What a great gesture thank you;o)  The suite was perfect. Once settled in we ordered room service, which was promptly delivered. Breakfast wide range of choice.

Service well beyond expectations! Good food and ambiance....,"At check-in it was found that there was an issue with the online booking but the Operations Manager (Rita) and the Reservations department (Endurance) went out of their way to address the issues.  The rooms are very comfortable with excellent bathrooms (walk in shower) and a standalone desk to work at.   We very much enjoyed the food, in addition to the service.

Old Glory - needs a face lift of the rooms,"I changed rooms and each of the rooms had serious issues of aging and dilapidated furniture and flooring.  My impression is that the hotel management is sucking out all the revenue they can extract from the establishment and will probably abandon ship at the end of the lease which could be imminent.  Else, how could i understand the total lack of reinvestment into maintenance and upgrade of the facility.  it is a disgrace to the name and standard of Protea Hotels.

Bathroom has a great shower and separate bath which was much appreciated. Wireless was good and fairly quick.  A few areas it could improve on is with the choice of food and how expensive it is to get food within the hotel. Breakfast is about ‚Ç¨18 and a simple burger is about ‚Ç¨25.

100% INTERNATIONAL SERVICE!,"Protea are a hotel brand with branches in Lagos state and across Africa. I stayed here for one night a few months back while attending an event in Victoria island. The location is spot on for clubbing, night life, events, meetings and attractions In the Victoria island/ Ikoyi area.  Service here is not only international but exceptional. You are catered for right to the very tee, and staff always give you that bit extra.   I arrived to find a spacious, well lit room with high quality bedding. It did not have that smell that most hotels in Lagos have when they have been vacant for a while (a damp musty odor).

Great Value for Money,"I have stayed at the Protea VI many times over the years and it's a great option for a business hotel in Victoria Island. It half as expensive as the top hotels in the area and it is almost as good. The service levels are now excellent, check-ins are quick and easy, waiters are friendly. The rooms have been refurbished and are very comfortable. Huge showers with good water pressure. The only negative is the Wi-Fi which is somewhere between patchy and non-existent. It seems to go down when the power goes off which is every half an hour or so and it's very slow when it's working, especially in the higher up rooms.

A little island of calm on VI,"I have been travelling to Lagos for the past 30 years on business and usually stayed at one of the main international hotels; this was my first stay at the Protea VI.   Anyone reading the TA reviews can get the message; this place has great service, it has clean, comfortable and stylish rooms, the food is excellent, everything works and it is very secure.   In fact, it is a little island of calm!   OK if you want glitz and action then it is not the place for you. The only disadvantage for my work is that there is limited space for meetings; just the (small) bar area and restaurant, because this place has no lobby in the traditional sense.

Breakfast was nice and we always had a particular waiter entertaining us about life in Nigeria and getting a smile out the ""not- a morning- persons"". The rooms are quite clean and we got clean towels every time we asked for them. I started reading a one of the hotel Novels by John Grisham and they agreed to lend it to me to take to Abidjan so I could finish it and my friend's sister in law would bring it back to them. For clubbers, there is the Rehab club/lounge quite nearby. It's a cool lounge with good music and quite a change from the very",December 2009,,,wrote a review Jan 2010,"Abidjan, Ivory Coast","['69 contributions', '18 helpful votes']",50,[]

Nice place but can do with better drive way and entrance,"This is an example of a very good hotel once you're in, but the approach road and even it's driveway to the lobby is really ugly. The room, service, food and even facilities in the hotel like Broadband and gym & pool, etc. are really nice. The bathrooms can do with more user friendly fittings like pegs near the shower, and a retractable cloths line (like at their Victoria Junction, Cape Town)",October 2009,,,wrote a review Nov 2009,Mumbai,"['183 contributions', '30 helpful votes']",40,[]

You could definitely do worse,"I can't imagine that any hotel in Lagos will be luxurious by western standards, but the Protea Kuramo Waters does a decent job all things considered.  The rooms are kept lean and bed linens are laundered daily.  Furnishings are relatively modern.  The Internet and TV were fairly reliable, but keep in mind that as with any hotels in VI, these services are fed from satellite rather than cable, so are subject to weather interference.  The bar and restaurant, while somewhat limited in selection, had some good items and some not so good.  The chicken and jollof rice was tasty and the minestrone soup was excellent, however the chicken wings were scrawny and tasteless and the steak sandwich was a bit light on the steak.  It kind of depends on what you get.  The pool is clean and",June 2009,,,wrote a review Oct 2009,"San Francisco, CA",['1 contribution'],30,[]
"Overpriced, lacks good management - can do much better though","I've stayed in several hotels in Lagos, and in this one a few times.  I have to admit that the service in this hotel is just a tad bit better than others, but they could do much better. For instance, the room I stayed in had complementary tea & coffee sachets, but the kettle was rusted (see picture).  Breakfast needs improvement also.   This would be a sub-$100 hotel anywhere else on earth but since its Lagos, the price per room is around $400.",September 2009,,,wrote a review Sep 2009,"Ahmedabad, India","['43 contributions', '19 helpful votes']",30,[]
VI Protea lacks competition,"I have stayed at this hotel a few times already.  I agree with much of what everyone says: very expensive hotel and not that great in return.  Rooms are substandard, water pressure is weak and senior management needs training.  A very good location and VI is the posh part of town so its no wonder protea charges what it does.  Power outages are common and takes staff a while to put the generator on; email is slow.  Food is mediocre at best.  Housekeeping and the guys at reception are great!",August 2008,,,wrote a review Jan 2009,"toronto, ON","['142 contributions', '160 helpful votes']",20,[]
Ok but over priced.,"I agree with all that is in Zinsky's Summary above....ok hotel, but nothing special given the price. The hotel was clean and surrounding guarded courtyard/parking area seemed safe enough. Nice enough bar and small pool area. That said smallish room with twin-sized bed, AC that never quite cooled the room below sweat point, front desk with an attitude, service in restaurant slow despite a lot of staff milling aimlessly about, buffet in restaurant (at $60) really the only choice of food besides lunch menu, internet access never available during my 2 week stay (except by phone at 20 a min), and no place to exercise...all disappoint for a $300/night hotel. Lord help you if you do not happen to carry a visa card‚Ä¶as any other method of payment is out of the question....despite, as",March 2008,,,wrote a review Mar 2008,walkabout9,"['3 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",20,[]
OK it is just barely,"I spent four days at this hotel in Nov. 2007 over a weekend and week days. Admittedly being here over the weekend must be factored in because I was quite bored yet it also gave me plenty of time to come to know the property's virtues and lack thereof. First my opinion was colored by the fact that the rooms are over $300 a night; it is simply way too overpriced, it in no way belongs in the category to charge this much. I am American but travel all over the world and have quite a bit of experience in different African countries, so I'm not holding my punches out of any sense of pc, etc. Also I just came from Senegal where the experience was great for two thirds the price. But for this price you get a barely adequate room, although clean.

Protea was OK,I stayed at the Protea in Apirl during the last elections.  The hotel was clean and the facilities were fine.  I had a problem with my water which was resolved quickly.  There was a problem with my safe which was not resolved for several hours which led to me flying internally without a passport.  The staff were helpful and curteous.,April 2007,,,wrote a review May 2007,London,"['1 contribution', '1 helpful vote']",30,[]
Safe and Nice,"Stayed in this hotel on a recent visit to lagos, i was quite impressed having heared all sorts of horror stories about the city. Upon arriving at the hotel, i was greated by a surprisingly well mannered staff, i was treated well and i felt a sort of tranquility not felt anywhere in the city. Maybe it was because i could see a couple of military men patrolling the surroundings. I definitely will recommend it to any safety conscious individuals visiting lagos.

Nice Stay On Victoria Island,"It was nice to find such a nice hotel in Lagos by our business partners. The staff is well educated and very friendly and helpful, the rooms are modern and clean.

Excellent! Very Impressed,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at Protea right after our wedding reception. I was very impressed with the courteous staff, nice pool and very cozy atmosphere. The actual room was a bit small  however the living section made up for the space. The staff was very poliet and attended to all our needs. We truly enjoyed our stay prior to returning to the states. I will definately return. The only draw back is that is was a bit pricy but I guess we were paying for the comfort, safety and amibance.",May 2005,,,wrote a review Nov 2005,New York; NY,"['2 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,[]
nice little place,"Nice hotel, nice location. A little bit small and, in my opinion, about 25% overpriced. But all in all very comfortable. It has an advantage over the bigger hotels, which seem to have a problem with maintenance, and tend to go through periods of delapidation. The new set of smaller hotels, some privately owned, seems to be the way forward in terms of comfort security and location.

"Decent, small, safe","It is a good hotel for the business traveller. It has a small dining area, average food,  small pool and  friendly staff. It is smallish for a hotel but you have all you need for your business needs, besides it is at the heart of Victoria Island. And as it is small, the staff can control the scammers who actaully prey on the visitors on other bigger business hotels on the island. The only negative is, it can be noisy if the generator is running ( and it does 1/3 of the time)...",November 2004,,,wrote a review May 2005,UK,"['2 contributions', '17 helpful votes']",30,[]
