I give you 5 Stars actually you deserve 0,"Well I really don’t know what to say about this Hotel/apartment complex. As I wrote in the headline I should give zero stars, on the other Hand the stuff is so lovely and helpless that you cant blame them. So I give 5 stars and hope they will improve. At least they try! The rooms are quite nice, the design is good almost everything important is working like shower, fridge, light etc. is clean!   Drawbacks: They have a lack of towels, you have to fight to get a new one, if you are lucky you will get a new in a few days. most likely a wet one because it was raining and it did not dry enough. If you put jour clothes to laundry don’t expect it within 24 hours, think in Africa time. maybe 2-3 days depend if the washing Lady Comes - or not. Swimming pool is there, I could not use it",October 2018,Traveled solo,Take the room with the most towels!,wrote a review Nov 2018,"Salzburg, Austria","['8 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",50,"['Cleanliness bubble_30', 'Service bubble_10', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"
My not so nice experience.,"This hotel has a prime location but, is poorly managed.   I stayed for a night but had a very terrible experience. I made a booking online for a reasonably sized room with all the package attached to it, but was allocated a small room that stinks like sewage.The odor was so pungent that  I couldn’t sleep. I had to go hangout in club nearby all night. It was that terrible. Found out that most of their rooms are dirty and have same dirty odor when I asked for a room change.   Why make a listing for services you don’t provide? Found myself proving to the lady manager that my online booking states clearly that the room comes with a complimentary breakfast. Insane! Why put your guest through that stress?  The internet didn’t work!   Good staff (who do everything to promote the",August 2018,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Aug 2018,,"['4 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",10,[]
Great Place!,"When I got to Lagos, I really was a bit nervous about where I would stay.  I found chapter 1 and for the price, it was amazing. They even had a free breakfast, their Akara is not like anything I ever tried before, I loved it!  The staff was really welcoming and the owner Tito was such a great help. She’s an artist and knew of a lot of space to check out in Lagos.  There were a few other expats around so I got chance to connect with them too. In all, It was really great and I’m staying here on my next trip to Lagos!",June 2018,Traveled solo,"affordable, great staff",wrote a review Aug 2018,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",['1 contribution'],50,"['Rooms bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
For the price and location. It's a steal,It's a steal. Good staff. Great location. Very accommodating.   There's a work space and pool and a grocery store just up the road. The owner is also really chill and helpful has a lot of tips on how to move around Lagos.,June 2018,Traveled on business,Each house on the property is different.

Home away from home,"1 was really sceptical about the place because of a previous experience but I did. From the security guy at the gate who was sooo funny, to the staff at the reception, i knew something had changed. I could have sworn that i was in the wrong place.  Chapter one is a home away from home, warm staffs, fun Friday nights activities, amazing view of the city and of course the soft cosy bed, not to mention the food. I was suppose to stay for a week but ended up staying for two weeks. definitely coming back. Please keep up with the new standard. miss you all",June 2018,Traveled on business,"every room has something nice to offer but my favourite was House 3 room 4, quiet and a great...",wrote a review Jul 2018,"Minna, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],50,"['Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Tamara and Amara make up for a terrible hotel,"This has to be by far one of the worst hotels I have ever been to. The two Managers Tamara and Amara looked after us personally and were wonderful in dealing with the many problems that arose during my stay here but as a great as it was does not make up for the fact that this is not a good hotel. We booked a room through booking.com for three people but upon arrival we were giving a tiny room (the room we booked was given away) and it only had a double bed. There was no towels or soaps for us to shower with. We were only given one breakfast per room, not per person, so was not enough for all of us. The television didn’t work, our shower did not have hot water for most of our stay, the shower had two shower heads both of which were Moldy and broken and this had not been resolved",January 2018,,,wrote a review Jan 2018,,"['4 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",20,[]
