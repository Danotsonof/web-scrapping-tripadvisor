In a class by itself,"I have read many reviews about this hotel on other sites and one of the reviews described it as one of the best-kept secrets in Lagos and I totally agree.   The first deciding factor for me whenever I go into any city is the nearness to the airport, security, and closeness to facilities, especially in a city like Lagos with unpredictable traffic.  Swiss Cottage is situated on a quiet residential street in the Alausa area of Ikeja which means it is a stone's throw to the seat of government in Lagos and also close to restaurants, banks, and the famous Ikeja City Mall. This makes for easy opportunities for relaxation as the mall has countless restaurants,  a cinema,  and numerous cafes.   Another deciding factor was the availability of comfort tools such as air-condition and",March 2022,,,wrote a review Apr 2022,"Accra, Ghana","['54 contributions', '20 helpful votes']",40,[]

Overpriced! Don't spend a night in this place,"So I booked 2 nights here based on reviews but this was the worst hotel I've ever slept at.   Starting with the location:   It's in a very tight street that barely accommodated 2 opposite lanes. It was hidden and it took the driver 5 minutes to locate it even though the GPS already said we've arrived. We drove into a small creepy compound.  The interior:  I doubt the place was built to be a hotel. It looked like a duplex was converted for commercial service. The lobby looked like a home mini bar. I was ushered to my room and I immediately demanded a change. Reasons being that the rooms were tiny, the bathroom door wouldn't even open completely without bumping into the hand washing basin. The shower leaked, it was small and the window doesn't open. The light was located at the",March 2016,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Oct 2016,"Boston, Massachusetts","['84 contributions', '39 helpful votes']",10,"['Cleanliness bubble_20', 'Service bubble_20', 'Sleep Quality bubble_30']"

Great hideout,"Swiss Cottage Suites Ikeja Lagos, we found very cosy with Friendly staff and hidden away from the hustle of Lagos city. The rooms were well appointed on both occasions we have stayed and the food and drinks requested were severed on time and as expected nevertheless the famous Ikeja mall is just 2 mins away where you can get all required including theSilverbird cinemas which we got as an offer on the first visit.  -Abdul From Dubai",December 2013,Traveled on business,Rooms upstairs are quieter.,wrote a review Feb 2014,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",['1 contribution'],40,"['Value bubble_40', 'Rooms bubble_40', 'Location bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']"
