"Large, comfortable and corporate; internet unreliable","On the upside, the rooms are huge and well equipped, albeit getting a bit dated. Several of my sockets didn't work. But it was comfy and clean with great city views . The 5th floor pool is v small but the outdoor bar is a nice place for a beer and chilling. The breakfast was extensive, though 'real' coffee (not pre-brewed) was charged extra. The Chinese restaurant was good and all the staff I met were friendly and helpful.  On the downside, the internet was ropey and I gave up and used my phone hotspot. The 4 lifts were very overburdened in the 08:30-09:00 peak period. After breakfast it took me 15 mins to get back up to the 16th floor. Not all lists serve all floors and they had programmed one lift to only serve the conference level (as there was a trade fair going on).

Excellent stay at lagos continental hotel,Excellent service as usual but not a perfect experience as was the case in my previous stay. Looks like some items on the breakfast table runs out from 9:30am and noticed some reluctance to refill even after I repeatedly asked. Also increased presence of what we call ‘yahoo boys’ in Nigeria in the hotel. I think they should select their crowd since it’s a favourite destination for companies.

Avoid Avoid Avoid - a 3-star hotel at best,"Not sure how this hotel is ranked a 5 star - maybe the standard of acceptance is very low. It's barely a 3 star hotel nothing more. If you like a fancy looking lobby, having someone press the lift button to your floor for you, and a swimming pool with a view, then it ticks those boxes. It's showing wear and tear in the bedrooms and common areas, especially the main dining room, where the food is sub-par both for breakfast and dinner, with the staff not much above that level either. Staff ran to my table as I was walking out to ensure I had filled in the slip for payment - I don't steal but was made to feel that way.

On my final night they gave me the normal allocation of two, plus a face towel. It sounds like nothing and I did not complain. But it’s annoying when you wash your face at night and you don’t want to use the dirty hand towel or unroll the bath towel. Even at budget hotels you get more towels.

Comfortable stay with a few glitches that can be improved,Stayed at lagos continental hotel for 12 nights . All in all I enjoyed my stay . The only things that made me upset was the power outages that happened on my trip . For a facility as big as this .. electricity has to be a constant regardless of Nigeria or not . I wasn’t happy with that because I paid to enjoy all these services . Especially as the internet went off due to these power outages and sometimes the hot water also wasn’t as hot as a result of this . But other than that it was a fabulous stay . Every staff I encountered was courteous and eager to help out . The breakfast at ekaabo was good as well with  a vast  variety . The club lounge was also a plus . My room was large and spacious .

Told the hotel while booking it was my wedding anniversary and they were thoughtful enough to give us a welcome anniversary cake.  Because we booked the club room, we had access to the club lounge, and having happy hour in the afternoon(free drinks) and light finger food and drinks from 6pm made it quite enjoyable.   The view from the floor was also great, both city and ocean views and it was bliss.  Breakfast was great, only wished they varied the menu more often.

SOHO Chinese restaurant,I am staying at the Lagos Continental Hotel.  Last night I dined in the Soho Chinese restaurant. I ordered shrimp fried rice and another shrimp entree.  I couldn’t finish both dishes and asked to have them put in a container so I could take them with me. I wanted to do it myself and ask them to bring the container. The server said no that they would put the food in the containers so that I could take it with me. I opened both containers today. They gave me the shrimp fried rice. But I got a beef dish instead of the other shrimp entrée. I have no idea what it is. And it doesn’t seem like they would make that sort of mistake.  So I’m wondering if it was intentional.,March 2022,,,wrote a review Mar 2022,"Des Moines, Iowa","['3 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",10,[]

Booking was full of red flags,"1. While the booking site showed that our payment had been declined, our card was still covertly debited. We thought this was just a system glitch, and we were ready to overlook it. But unfortunately, it ended up being the narrative for the remainder of the booking process.  2. We went ahead with the booking selecting the bed only option. But the hotel went ahead and covertly charged the card for full-board. No communication or consultation. They just charged the card. Once again, we would never have known if the bank hadn't alerted us about the transaction. 3.

Breakfast in the main hall had a lot of options, but most things were cold and just unpalatable due to that, to eat. A huge line to wait for eggs.

Forewarned is forearmed,"I stayed in a Kings suite twin room on the 17th floor from Friday 25th to Sunday 27th February 2022 and so I feel qualified to warn you. Throughout your stay the service will be consistently poor. Getting checked in will take almost 30 minutes (yes, even though you called ahead to notify them of your planned check in that evening!). No one will help with luggage or even direct you to the room; you should prepare to figure it out yourself. Every time you call anyone it will be the same experience - reception, restaurant, reservations, housekeeping, porters: the phone will just ring and ring. Eventually after several tries, someone will answer and promise to call you back in about five minutes. It is a lie; they will not call you.

Mr.,"My experience with the Lagos Continental Hotel crew: The first contact with Lagos Continental Hotel was Miss Norah, she was consistent and diligent with her job.  Another staff I met that was wonderful is Mr Oyeniyi , he was so organised & he made check- in process for my guests  easy despite our large crowd arriving at the same time.  Mr. Oyeniyi's reception at the front desk and the way the banquet team took charge of situations will be the reason I want to visit the Lagos Continental Hotel again. Those wonderful guys made my job easy.  Tunde Whenu.",October 2021,,,wrote a review Nov 2021,"Lagos, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],40,[]

My stay at Lagos Continental,"I have stayed at Lagos Continental for 6 weeks and still counting. What really makes me wonder is how I have to reintroduce myself everyday after work to men who stand by the elevator. They are dismissive, and subtly condescending.  It is a fail on the part of the hotel to have these men harass long-staying guest. If anyone pays for 6 weeks in a hotel and uses the elevator everyday, it makes no sense not to enjoy the courtesy of familiarity. Those men at the elevator diminishes any other good that should come out of my experience. They make me angry every night I come back from work and have to use the elevator.  Other than that, I like the gym and morning buffet.  I will personally commend Femi - one of the managers.

The room is tastefully decorated with contemporary furniture. I would suggest investing in some firmer pillows. The front desk staff was very welcoming and friendly, same can be said about all staff.

"A crude, rude and absolutely awful set up","This place has the benefit of a name that inspires trust. It is however, all glitz without substance.   Some staff are polite and welcoming. We were shown suites, they all had a nasty smell. I cant understand why this can’t be sorted out.   Because of the situation at the time, we gave frank feedback to the manager and he was polite enough to listen. We agreed to stay for a while we were offered a special deal. I was horrified to find when we returned rude security men denied us entry. It was an odd display of arrogance which was off putting and frankly unacceptable. We thought it was a mistake and showed him our offer slip, it was a waste of time. The chap took the slip sauntered off came back and said without a firm booking, we couldn’t come in.

"This hotel is packaged on the outside, aka lobby ONLY.","This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. It is a glorified motel and that's putting it nicely. Starting from the dirty disgusting bathrooms that didn't  look like they'd been cleaned for years to the stained mirrors, absolutely poor room lighting, several light bulbs out. Tattered torn furniture. TV with less than basic cable channels. Constant electricity outages which went on for 5 whole days. For a city as hot and humid as Lagos, you cannot go without air conditioning but the Lagos Continental hotel doesn't seem to be able to grasp that basic concept.  Very very  very slow elevators.   The room service was by far the slowest I have ever encountered, that is if you get anyone to answer the phone.

Our room attendant Christopher has been the most kind and gentle souls we’ve met since being in Lagos. He has been very detail orientated as well as helpful. I feel very safe having him in our room.

I would not spend this kind of money at the Continental in Lagos again, but would choose somewhere else for 1/3 the price and almost the same experience and service.   The nice things I can say are that the rooms and facilities were all great. The rooms clean and large, with well functioning AC.

The staff are extremely friendly hospitable and willing to help. This journey experience begins right from Check-in to House Keeping & Room Service and Restaurants. However, the only put-off was the Business Center. If you are on a business trip it is advised not to depend on the business center service as it is not manned on week-ends with systems closed and not opeartional. The hotel charges Nira 150 per page to photocopy and thats not appreciated if services of booking training rooms have been availed for over 3 days.Printing should have been complimentary. After all request is not to print books but a few pages. Strongly",June 2019,,,wrote a review Jun 2019,,"['85 contributions', '53 helpful votes']",50,[]
Very pleasant experience!,"Just come back from my second week-long stay in Lagos in a month. I used this hotel both times. I found the Continental an absolute oasis of comfort and calm. The facilities are good but the professional attitude and efficiency of the staff made my stay really pleasant. No request was too small or too much trouble. I was particularly impressed that I used the hotel to book all my car transport and in over 20 journeys not one driver was late or failed too find me.  As one reviewer noted, the hotel is no longer Intercontinental but the staff has stayed the same apparently. I found the standard as high as any major chain hotel. Both visits the room was clean, the bed comfortable, the wifi signal good and meal selection broad.

From the security guards at the main entrance to the security at the lobby, servers, room attendants and the ever ready to help front desk employees. I have stayed at other hotels during my stay in Lagos but this one won my heart. Their level of professionalism and politeness was mind blowing. One thing that means a lot to me is customer service.

Disgusting,This property use to be the Intercontinental. It was beautiful. Now it's the Continental. It's disgusting. There was mold in our room. The sheets were dirty. They brought new sheets and they were dirty. The hotel had an awful smell when we first walked in everyday. This property has gone down tremendously. They watered down the soap in the bathrooms near the spa. They had fans on in the spa and the restaurants because there was no air. This property is definitely a 2 star property. Stay at EKO or the Radisson Blu. They cut corners at this property and you can tell. None of the plugs work in the room. So we couldn't charge our phones.  It was just dirty.

Then I didn’t have hot or warm water to shower for half of my stay and ended up showering in my colleague room.

After bribing our way through customs ($20 each) we were (thankfully) met in the arrivals lounge by some colleagues from work. Check-in was ok for the other guys but I was delayed as they had ""lost"" my reservation.  Initial impressions both of the hotel in general and the room I was allocated were very good. However, this soon turned to disappointment when we noticed that the pool was under repair as this was one of the main reasons I agreed to stay in this hotel. The other reason, the gym, didn't disappoint: dumbbells up to 30kg, enough for a reasonable workout, a good selection of machines, a Smiths machine (maybe made by Precor) and two (yes TWO) new-ish Concept2 machine (gymadvisor will give this gym a 3.5 stars review).",January 2019,,,wrote a review Jan 2019,"Dudley, United Kingdom","['42 contributions', '81 helpful votes']",30,[]

I was shocked and scared, and really didn't know what to do. I called the hotel and their staff calmed me down first then suggested me to come back to the hotel first. I did not want to leave the police station because of the fear but he said he will arrange a hotel car with security guy to escort me back. He quickly arranged the hotel car and while I was waiting at the police station, he was constantly checking up on me and kept me posted.

It offers all the facilities that you would expect of a hotel of this class, including restaurants, business centre and recreational facilities.  My room was large and spacious, and the wifi worked well enough. But, ...  The bathroom's partitioning wall were made of glass and, therefore, see through. Yes, there were blinds for privacy, but why on earth design the room this way in the first place. My room was also very dark, so it was often difficult to see when working at my laptop.

She was always extremely kind and even remembered my name and said hello when we saw each other on the property. Also, Christine who worked as a server in the Milano restaurant provided excellent service as well.  With that being said, there were not really any other aspects of the hotel that impressed me.

Horrible stay. Will never visit again.,"First of all, the hotel has a stinky, mouldy smell. Being located as it is, in a very humid city like Lagos, it is not suited for the thick carpeting in the corridors, which are also very poorly ventilated, leading to the perpetual smell of mould. This was my second stay in this very expensive hotel, with no value for money. When I checked in, after midnight, the hotel bedsheets had not been changed. I found some hairs and disgusting marks on them. It took housekeeoing ten calls and three hours to change them. The shower water was always lukewarm, never hot. I complained, to no avail. The staff would rummage through my things in my absence, forcing me to buy padlocks for my bags.

I also had room service once, which was also fine.  As a woman traveler, safety is sometimes a consideration, and I must say that I felt quite safe at this hotel.  There is a gentleman manning the elevators at all time, so it's difficult for random people to go up.  The hotel is surrounded by a manned gate and there are metal detectors on entering the hotel.  I will stay here again when I return to Lagos.",June 2017,,,wrote a review Jul 2017,"New Canaan, Connecticut","['105 contributions', '94 helpful votes']",40,[]
Great  accomodation..but restaurant service needs work,Stayed at the Intercon for a week and for the most part everything went well. Room service was okay and Internet connection was okay and you get a great view of the city. Only problem I had was sure their restaurant. There was no bacon or pork sausage during breakfast for my entire stay. That's pretty basic stuff and none of the staff could explain they weren't serving it. They just answered with a smile.,February 2017,,,wrote a review Jul 2017,"Atlanta, Georgia","['73 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",30,[]
NOT a Happy Traveler,"Check-in and Front Desk people were fine. Thanked me for being platinum elite. Room was clean, same room as last time no upgrade, No battery in tv remote, called concierge and a guy came up 45 minutes later- obviously angry with being the one to come up and fix this problem. Asked him to unlock mini bar. Said he didn't have a key but would come back. Nobody came back, called downstairs and asked again. Nobody ever came. Dinner was a terrible they said it would be 45 minutes to get a chicken baguette sandwich so I should eat buffet. I opted to wait for the sandwich and wish I hadn't. Breakfast is a disaster- none of the tables have been cleared off from previous diners. Sat at a big round table where others had already eaten and left their plates.

The rooms and bathrooms were clean and tidy, the food in the restaurant was good with a fairly wide selection, and the staff quite pleasant and courteous.

I mentioned that the room was a bit drab, the furniture dirty (big wine stain on the couch) and some issues with the bathroom. Sure enough, once i got back the furniture had been replaced.

Good hotel for Nigeria standards,The hotel was nice. Location is ok if your business related meetings etc are in central Lagos. I guess if your visit is business related transportation will not be an issue. The rooms are really soacious. They feel quite dated though. Reception desk and room service are quite slow. Think in advance if you want to order food. Check in and check out takes some time too. Nice breakfast for the ones that feel ok trying different local fruit and delicacies. Buffet dinner also looked quite interesting. I didn't try much of the food because I had a full day of traveling the next day and didn't want to take any risks.

Nice hotel,"The Intercontinental is close to my office, so we usually lodge there when needed and also lodge our colleagues who come from out of town there also. While it's has a nice ambience, the reservation staff are impolite (even when sending emails, they don't address guests properly!). The staff also seem to have a hard time adhering to instructions regarding bills, always harassing us and our guests for payments during our stay before we check out  - even though we make substantial advance payments at check-in. We always leave strict istructions that we will cover our guests' bills along with ours, but they seem to not understand this.

The view on the city is superb from the higher floors and the hotel is really fantastically built. A special thought for the bath cabin with its automatic curtains.

A lift was making some awful noise, the lock on my door was broken (thought it was fixed within 24hrs), the bedhead's lamps were not working and spare parts were not available to fix them I was told.

Going south but still one of the better option in Lagos,Compared to last year a pretty average check in experience. No real recognition of platinum status. Nigeria is in such a bad economical stage that obviously most of the hotel staff is suffering too. Three lamps not working - only two got fixed.  My advise to fellow business travelers: don't exchange USD into Naira. The hotel is taking advantage of you. Change with your colleagues or friends. Never ask the reception about when to leave the hotel for the airport. They are desk jokers and totally clueless. They still recommend 3 hours ;-). But overall it has been a pleasant stay in the hotel. Not even Intercon can change the bad experience at the airport. As for Patrick as your hotel taxi driver.

As expected the rooms were spacious with very comfortable beds. good toilet accessories and excellent meals at the Ekaabo Restaurant downstairs.

Happy Hour at the lounge was also good with a mix of exotic drinks.  I have a few complaints though. The first was with regard to my check-in.

Some goods...but unfortunately some bads...,"I've been staying at this IHG location since it opened a few years ago and have watched it go through phases. As a Sphire Ambassador with IHG, I have to say I have noticed a few improvements but unfortunately, also areas that need further attention.   One of the most noticeable improvements in recent times is the service and courteousness of the staff. Everyone must have a new KPI  as the smiles and willingness to support is definitely felt.  Unfortunately an area that remains unattended to is the room service/in house dining. The food ordering and delivery have remained consistent but the presentation of the food is one of the worst I've noticed for a hotel of this caliber...no effort.

A very Good Stay,"I recently had to travel to Lagos, Nigeria on business and was shocked at the prices of hotels in this city. I found this hotel  online and the Tripadvisor reviews seemed good so I booked it.  I was very impressed - the security, the room, the bathroom, the free high speed wifi and the quality of restaurant food were all excellent. The staff were very friendly and accommodating - from the breakfast chef who asked me every morning if I had a good sleep to the duty manager that went out of his way to accommodate me when I needed some help.

An Oasis in Africa,"Staying in the Intercontinental Lagos, reminded me of staying in the Oberoi in Mumbai. I had the same feeling of stepping into an oasis of calm from the chaos of the streets.   The Intercontinental is a good hotel and I guess it should be for the price.  The food I ate was fine if not the best and the rooms were well appointed.  Slightly more should be done on making sure the rooms are spotlessly clean and maintained and there are some signs of wear and tear but that is me being picky.

Hotel is pretty quiet, which is something I always look forward to when I travel.  A downside is the location of the AC. It faces the reading table directly and the vent cannot be adjusted upwards. Upshot of this is that you may not be able to work more than 2 hours straight at the table unless you switch off the AC. Higher temp settings didn't seem to help.  Also, the beddings have some sort of mild dampness. I couldn't quite figure out the cause.

Reservation on Prepayment all good and well but on arrival there was no AC and where is the refund?,"Didn't get past the front door.  I took the time to decide which hotel to stay in and on arrival to the Intercontinental they advised me that they had no cooling system (AC) and hadn't for the last two days.  Why didn't they tell me that before I arrived? Sorry about that.  Well it was the most frustrating experience and I will not take a chance to book here again.   Then, you would think that they would do an automatic refund and maybe email an apology?  Well no.

Which meant apart from suffering under the obviously very polluted underground, the looked extremely unpresentable because all of them were sweating like pigs.

The gym is good, when the aircon works but should not the machines be hooked up to the tv?   Rooms are large and nice, but would appreciate the tv working.  The restaurants cannot split a bill, so be prepared to organize the bill between you, with cash.  In the Italian, the antipasto buffet is misrepresented as free but costs $20 for very little.

The elevators were a bit wonky but I appreciated the security.  Dinner in the main restaurant (forgotten the name, but it's on the lobby level) is buffet-only, and quite expensive unless you are planning on eating a lot.

A 5 Star Hotel with 1 Star Service!!!!,"Intercontinental Hotel Lagos is a disaster in service delivery! Majority of the staff are not well trained and effectively instructed per time therefore they make endless costly mistakes when it comes to guest services. The staff also lack the finesse that 5 Star service requires and don't operate as a united, effective team but adopt the blame game. Secondly the toilet in my room (1120) had a permanent foul odour emitting directly from the sewage system that grew worse by the day. I complained immediately I checked in and the receptionist promised to send someone to check it but never did nor followed up for the entire 3 nights I lodged there.

That I am soooooo unbelievably disappointed is an absolute understatement.   The hotel lost its value so early and if they continue this way then the hotel it's definitely going to be shut down soon.  It's an ok hotel but lacks the people and the process. The service received and still receiving is zero, I went out and returned at 4pm and my room had not been cleaned. When my room was finally 'cleaned' I observed some of the displaced items in my room were still there and my trash can wasn't emptied, I am sure the room wasnt swept either.

Dreadful service - consistently,"I have stayed here several times and it keeps getting worse. The hotel has many ingredients for success: great location, good sized rooms, decent fittings and linens. However it falls massively short on two fronts. One, food. Generally not very good, especially the so-called Chinese/Asian restaurant which is simply awful. Two, and most importantly, service. Checking in and out takes forever, getting room service is a nightmare, waiters in the restaurants are disinterested and forgetful and cleaning of rooms is sporadic. I came back after a day of meetings at 7pm to find my room had not yet been serviced. I called housekeeping who informed me ""the hotel is full so we have been very busy."" Hmmm.

My room was to standard and comfortable.  Room service was efficient and all staff friendly and welcoming.  Breakfast was satisfactory with an adequate selection.    Now my little niggles which are minor but when compared to other facilities are worthy of comment (at least from my perspective).  When the hotel is near capacity the hot water can run short.

Rooms were very comfortable and gave us the comfort we desired as we wanted to be just out of home but not too far. Breakfast was just above average and offered some variety. It was basically the same thing however on a daily basis and a little more variety will help. The club lounge was also a breathe of fresh air if you needed somewhere quiet to do some work and have an early hour drink.

Standards thrown out of the window,"Intercontinental started with great reviews. After all, what you can take away is the investment to build such an impressive hotel.   However all that's gone with the wind.  Before my gripe, I can attest that the front desk is good and friendly. Same for the folks in the different restaurants. The rooms are very OK but room service can be tardy at times.  The location is horrible: it is on a side street and driving and parking is poorly coordinated. Recently government made the road a one way but that only helped a bit.  Only god knows what inspired the lifts. It is annoying and complex to operate or understand.

Comfortable western standard business hotel,"I stayed here for four nights and found it to cover all the basic needs. It's a new hotel which still has some teething troubles over power in particular. The rooms are very spacious and well designed in my view. The decor is functional rather than designed to be welcoming and as a result the bars and restaurants lack real character or personality. The lobby is enormous but the standard of finishings generally are more impressive in scale than quality. The food was pretty good, if expensive as one would expect. There is a fifth floor terrace bar which is nice in the evenings but if it rains it doesn't leave many good options for a hotel of its scale.

Ok hotel- shame about the maintenance.,"I've stayed in many Intercontinental hotels in some great cities around the world. But, this is by far the most disappointing. Firstly upon arrival in the spacious lobby, the whiff of food is carried throughout the hotel- the smell is not at all welcoming and actually smells a lot like bad oil, which is a shame seeing as the decor is quite clean and modern.  I think the hotel is quite inadequately staffed, either that or the staff aren't receiving proper training, because some seem not to know what is going on in the hotel.  The room size was nice but again didn't feel clean, there were a few marks on my towel and the room smelt a bit damp.

Nice enough but not the standard you'd expect,"Intercontinental is my hotel of choice when I travel for business, with the brand comes an expectation around quality of the service and of the property.  Travelling to Lagos can be more exhausting then most similar length journeys due to extreme delays at immigration, corrupt officials interrogating you on trumped up requirements (Mine was an absence of a yellow fever vaccination card), and the anxiety of travelling through the incredible depressing poverty with an armed escort to your hotel room that probably cost more in a night then some might see in a month or even a year.    At least, that was my experience.

Ate in both the Chinese and Italian restaurants and again was very happy with the quality.

Secure and Safe Stay in Lagos,My initial brief was to stay somewhere that was safe and secure. From the minute you enter through the security gates you feel a sense of security. So I was pleasantly surprised at the standard. The rooms are amazing with modern bathrooms including separate shower and bath (no sliding around in the bath while trying to take a shower). The gym is modern and if you are not in a rush you can have a full workout on almost everything you could wish for. The only downside is the price of meals and beverages. A coke costs 750 Naira (roughly 5 USD or R50). A not so great Pizza about 3500 Naira (21 USD or R250). So a bit of a rip off. Bring your own supplies.

Nice hotel - Has potential but needs work,The title says it all… the hotel has potential… the hotel appears to have been built then like many other projects stopped due to what was probably a funding issue. Then you can see the hotel was finished but with a smaller budget. The final fit/finish just does;t match the rest of the hotel. The lifts are atrocious - the theory is good - you press your floor on s keypad and the programming routes a lift that will only stop on your floor and others nearby. So in theory it should be faster. But in reality the programming gets overloaded in peak hours and especially when he hotel is full.

Ice box sterile,"I cannot believe this is the Real Thing.

Nice New Hotel in Lagos,"The Intercontinental Hotel in Lagos is pretty new. The Rooms are very luxerious furnished. Since it is new everything is in working order.

Certainly Up to Par,"One of the newer establishments on the island, the Intercontinental Hotel Lagos is a brilliant addition to the ever changing landscape indeed.  The property towers above most of the structures in the area and as such, it is easily spotted from most vantage points, offering guests (if you're fortunate to secure a room on a higher floor) stunning views of the nearby lagoon and Lagos' commercial hub. A homecoming for me after having been away for fair amount of time, I was quite impressed with not just the property but vicinity as well. It's quite well maintained and does seem safe enough (something I know a healthy amount of travelers may be concerned with).

By 11p.m that night we still did not have a second room because we were told that the room that had been prepared for us had maintenance issues.

Some of my colleagues received dirty rooms, with hand marks on furniture and dirty linen. The suite I was in was clean, though, and large with nice panoramic windows, but the bathroom flooded after every shower as the shower door was not insulated and the shower floor was the same level as the floor outside.

Business Trip to Lagos,The Intercontinental Hotel is a hotel with opulence and style from the lobby to the reception and the room. I stayed in one of the One of the King Superior Room. The service was excellent. I also used their car hire service. It is also quite pricey comparable to what you pay in other group hotels owned and manged by IHG abroad i.e in England and US.  The Dining was good and with array of selection of both continental and African delicacies. There are however moments of staff losing focus with regards to dining protocols and customer service.

A New Hotel in Lagos ( a breath of fresh air),"I recently traveled to Nigeria for work and decided to try the newly opened intercontinental hotel. I usually stay at another international brand hotel in Lagos which is very good too. For a new hotel, The Intercontinental Hotel Lagos did not disappoint. The service is good, the rooms are clean... The restaurants are very impressive. The Italian Restaurant in particular was very good, it has amazing food (the fillet steak was to die for) the Chinese restaurant was not bad either.  Thanks to a few people that made my stay memorable in the hotel. Lola (concierge) was amazing - thank you! Mohammed (front office manager) very polite and helpful, always there when you need anything. Not forgetting The Exec chef Austen - thank you for the hospitality. Will definitely come back...",August 2013,,,wrote a review Sep 2013,,"['17 contributions', '13 helpful votes']",40,[]
Excellent hotel,"Really nice hotel, the service excellent , free wifi although strangely does not work in the restaurant, excellent gymnasium.  Only gripe is the hotel lifts are automated and got confused a couple of times and with the power outages do not seem to be on emergency power.  Would definitely stay here again.",September 2013,,,wrote a review Sep 2013,Johannesburg,"['29 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",50,[]
Weekend in Lagos,This is the newest hotel on Victoria Island. I have just spent the weekend here and have no complaints. There are snagging issues but thats a given considering the hotel has only just opened so everything is completely new and settling.  The food is excellent though pricy. The restaurant and bar staff are particularly well trained by local standards and the general experience has been very good.  The rooms are big and the bathrooms very nice. The internet is probably the fastest I have experienced in Nigeria. The views from the full glass windows in all the rooms is excellent.   Location - its central Victoria Island which makes it convenient for working round VI and Ikoyi.  I will definitely stay here again.,September 2013,,,wrote a review Sep 2013,Mombasa,"['9 contributions', '9 helpful votes']",40,[]
FINALLY A VERY GOOD HOTEL IN LAGOS ! THE BEST ONE,"I stayed there 4 night for business in sept. the hotel is brand new (opened in july 2013) and it is a pleasure to find a so nice hotel in Lagos.  Price is really competitive compare with the quality and the service in the building. I paid 250 euros per night which is OK in Lagos. All employees are very kind and helpful. Check in and Check out was very quick and well done. They take AMEX and VISA. The bedroom are very big (I was staying at the 8th floor) and luminous. The bathroom is very nice and the bed very comfortable. Lots of places to put things in drawers.  Air conditionning in rooms is easy to use as well as the lights. The wifi is very quick and free and works very well everywhere in the hotel. You do not need to enter several password, the log in is automatic.

"Excellent Hotel, Great Experience","Stayed at the Intercontinental hotel with my husband to mark his birthday. It was all we wanted and more. The lobby is great. Lovely and spacious rooms with real attention to details paid to the fittings and furnishing.  The welcome was awesome - Great staff - very warm and on top of their game. Good team work between the staff.  Special gift, Fruit basket, Champagne, fruit platter and desert spread on arrival.  We felt really special. Personal touch to celebrate the birthday from the restaurant to the guest relationship unit and indeed the whole staff was like family with everyone wishing us a happy birthday.  Lunch at the restaurant with family members was a huge success -great food in a really beautiful restaurant.

"Great hotel, great service","Excellent hotel, the rooms are great, the services are great, the food is very good. You feel safe, you feel clean and you can relax in the restaurant or in the bar. There is a security guy on every floor.  I liked the traditional flavor which is brought by the people meeting you in the lobby, or in the restaurant.  The rooms are very large, with a lot of equipment, large screen, even has a desk, where you can work. The internet is working very good, and it is included in the price. Excellent breakfast, with a large variety. Huge bathroom, with tub, separate shower and separate restroom, it give you a feeling of a spa :), with glass wall for view over the room Also a very well provided mini-bar.  Overall, an excellent stay,",July 2013,,,wrote a review Jul 2013,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania","['257 contributions', '62 helpful votes']",50,[]

A wonderful new addition to Victoria Island,I had the honour of being invited to pre-opening trials at the about to open InterContinental Lagos. This is definitely the new shining star in Nigeria. Beautiful spacious well appointed rooms. The team is really wonderful. Well trained and very responsive. They are really proud to be part of this new Property. Only the all day dining was open during my visit but the menu variety was great.
