Friends Wedding!,"I loved this hotel so much! The rooms were well decorated and spacious. It was my first time in Nigeria and I was worried about eating the local food but the food at the hotel was amazing! I also loved that we did not have to worry about a language barrier, the staff were very helpful and recommended places for us to see during our stay. 5/5 for me!",August 2022,,,wrote a review Sep 2022,,['2 contributions'],50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"

Very homely service,"Stayed over for three nights at Charlies and had a good experience. Its situated rightly as access to the major spots of the city is just between 5-30 minutes drive depending on where. Would like for them to change their stylish but functionally unhygienic bathroom taps and also get a seemless transition from grid to generator. Otherwise, they are good, managed and serviced by ever smiling (genuinely) happy people.",November 2014,Traveled on business,They usually give you the best,wrote a review Dec 2014,"Banjul, Gambia","['7 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",40,"['Rooms bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_50']"
Awesome,The location is just at the right spot for a first timer in Nigeria. The environment is just outstanding especially the security. A getaway that am not not sure to forget easily. It's truly a real home away from home!!!,September 2014,Traveled with friends,,wrote a review Sep 2014,"Lagos, Nigeria",['5 contributions'],50,[]
