"-1, bad as it can be FRAUD","Disaster Book the room and have paid in advance. 50% of lights in the room are not operational, They charge for freshly squiezed fruit juce,fresh coffee, fresh bread...instead you get certain juice, instant coffed, tost bread that is not tosted. And there us nothing else you may order as they are serving only 20$ of the menue. And of course you will have to pay for breakfast as one you havw paid with the room reservarion does not inckede nothing of above.  Room seevice is not available except for water.. All together disaster... But paid in advance, two nights more then 150 USD, in return I got back what value maybe 60 USD...or less. Place to sleep...relatively safe",August 2021,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Aug 2021,Ecuador,"['42 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",10,[]
Staffs treat you based on their preference,I ordered food but they refused to serve me water … what kind of stupid person does that. I’d advise you go with your water to the restaurant whenever you want to eat. The food is tasteless too. Also hold 20 naira to bribe the woman at the restaurant … she’s a low life,August 2021,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2021,"Ibadan, Nigeria","['6 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",10,[]
Oppressive Outside Music Kiosk,"This is a well furnished, comfortable hotel and it’s my second time staying here. However I doubt I’ll return again. This is because there is now a music kiosk in front of the hotel that insists on blasting music so loud it’s impossible to sleep. It’s that bad. The hotel management have refused to do anything about it or report it. The noise comes right through the closed windows. Sadly this will cost this wonderful hotel a lot repeat business. No customer is going to come back to suffer this noise oppression.  The noise has definitely robbed it of a five star rating.",May 2021,Traveled solo,,wrote a review May 2021,,['1 contribution'],30,[]
My âme Sake,"I stay at the JoyGate Hotel Airport Road and I know you have a lot of choices, but if you want excellent service, good food cooked to your order fresh by Chef Cilas, good employees manager by Matthew, and good customer service by Emmanuel, I recommend the JOYGATE.  I love loved loved my ceramic tile room, Hugh TV, learn and the best bed ever!!! I can't wait to come back.

Safe choice close to the airport,"Joygate hotel and suites is close to the airport in Lagos. This is a modern hotel with air conditioning, comfortable beds and an outdoor pool.  The restaurant is nothing special. We tried both breakfast and dinner - rather uninspiring.  The hotel can arrange airport pickup and also excursions with heavily armed officers as protection, which is recommended if you are white.  Free Wi-Fi. Friendly staff. Slow service. They manage to find strange extras like “the breakfast is only included for one person in a double room”. Annoying.  The hotel is a safe choice in Lagos.",October 2019,,,wrote a review Dec 2019,"Stockholm, Sweden","['1472 contributions', '175 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_40', 'Service bubble_30', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']"
A true 5 star,"Travelling back to the UK, I stayed here for a few hours as my flight was a late night flight. Hotel is as impressive on the outside as it is in the inside. Staff where alert, friendly and professional. Hotel is modern and has the latest and up to date technology. But I must say the staff where absolutely class, and are a credit to the hotel.   The hotel is a little bit out of the way, very close to the airport.",November 2019,,,wrote a review Nov 2019,"Liverpool, United Kingdom","['4 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",40,"['Rooms bubble_50', 'Cleanliness bubble_50', 'Service bubble_40']"
Home away from Home,"Joygate hotel is indeed a home away from home! Strategically located along airport road, in a serene environment with friendly and dedicated staff. The rooms, roof top bar, and swimming pool  is a wonderful sight to behold. Wont forget the IPTV experience where i had the experience of chatting with my friends on Facebook via the 47 inches television in my room, also was able to place my order right from my television set. I will surely visit Joygate again when next in Nigeria.",June 2019,Traveled on business,The best hotel along the airport road in Nigeria.,wrote a review Jun 2019,Texas,['1 contribution'],50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"
Horrible Place,"Their staff are Anti-Americans and made several statements that they do not trust Americans and profile them. The hotel has a horrible odor, it smells like a rat died somewhere. The whole hotel is infested with mosquitos and flies that bite you, like cesar flies. There are dead cockroaches in the swimming pool and the tall Yoruba guy that works at the pool was told to remove them and he was scared to, saying that is not his duty. It took them 2 hours to remove them and right after they did a family went into the pool right where the cockroaches were, and their kids were drinking that dirty water. The first thing you see when you enter the hotel is the trash on the left side that stinks very badly. The employees spy on their customers and some are suspected anti-American’s and",May 2019,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jun 2019,,['1 contribution'],10,"['Rooms bubble_10', 'Location bubble_10', 'Service bubble_10']"
