Great apt,Great serviced apt. We enjoyed the location especially the access to a lot of the places I wanted to be out around town. the family enjoy the chef who cooked up some great meals.

Poor customer service,"We stayed at Amara Suites in December 2016, booked through Ezee travel agency. It was a good start, apartment was clean and fully furnished, reception was friendly and staff courteous.  By the evening we noticed a few things, our ground floor apartment had doors leading  to the patio  and balconies that wouldn't lock - the key was broken. We were told nothing could be done that night but promised maintenance would look into it in the morning. That night sleep was evasive because we were concerned for the security of our children. The doors were not fixed till day 3 due to lack of spare parts. By day 3 we noticed a window that wouldn't shut. That too had to be fixed.  Bathroom door wouldn't shut because it didn't fit the door frame, when we tried to shut it on got locked in and",December 2016,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Jan 2017,United Kingdom,"['45 contributions', '13 helpful votes']",20,[]
"Good location, did not live up to expectations","While the flats are in a good location in Lagos (I stayed at Emem Court) and looked great in photos online, it felt dry and slightly abandoned. It looked a bit run down and was depressing to stay in. The treadmill at the gym was broken down, meaning I didn't feel safe using it to actually run.   However the bed was very comfortable. The steward was also very friendly and cooked delicious food. This place could use a facelift to rejuvenate it's design and make it worth the trouble. Until then I would not go back.",August 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2016,"Nairobi, Kenya","['61 contributions', '13 helpful votes']",30,[]
Extremely helpful and amenable staff and good location,"Thank you so much for making our stay so easy. The apartment was ideally located for meetings in Ikoyi and the staff at Amara did everything to make us comfortable and for our stay to be smooth. James, our Steward was wonderful and a brilliant cook which was a delight for us and the delightful Mr Abbah, drove us about to meetings as well as collecting us and dropping us back at the airport.

A very brilliant and pleasant stay,"Our stay at Amara suites was great. We were there 10 days in end of July. The flat was beautifully presented and very clean. Our steward was incredibly helpful in purchasing food and preparing incredible dishes that we were looking forward to eat at each meal.   The flat also comes with cleaning services comprising of several staff members which enabled the job to be done in a very short timeframe. Uninterrupted access to internet, gym facilities (though treadmill was not available to everyone), washing machine, car service and driver, everything was made available to make our stay in Lagos as easy and practical as possible.

Wonderful entry to Lagos as a long stay hotel,"Amara has a great location.  It is more an apt than a hotel.  It is staffed by a professional team.  Each apt is assigned a steward.  Every problem I had  -  and there are always problems in Lagos :o), the team addressed very quickly.  I enjoyed my stay there (6 months) and would recommend it, particularly expats who need a soft landing into Lagos as they look for long term accomodation.  The only problem that was never resolved while I was there was the AC in the gym.  I suppose by now it's fixed.  There is a tennis court but the surface has not been maintained.  The diehards still played on it anyway.

Excellent Service,"I stayed at Amara Suites Serviced Apartment at Banana Island for 3 weeks in April 2015 and it was truly home away from home. The staff at Amara Suites worked very well as a team which made my stay pleasant and enjoyable.  There are two particular individuals at Amara Suites, Tonye Maxwell (Client Liaison Officer) and Kayode my driver who went over and beyond the call of duty to make my stay even more pleasurable, so for that I am very grateful.  I will strongly recommend Amara Suites to family, friends and anyone travelling to Lagos, Nigeria.

"Amara Suites, the place to be","Please do not think twice about Amara Suites, it is really a great place to stay. It is clean, spacious, wifi (hig speed), a steward attached to your apartment, modern day kitchen utilities and decor. I was at the Anike court.  I am defintely going back there when I am on Holiday in Nigeria.  Never knew we had such great serviced apartments in Nigeria.  Cheers!

"Best Place to Stay In Lagos, Nigeria","This place was perfect for the family trip.  I had more than enough living space for us to enjoy one another and still have our own privacy.  The location was secure and the staff was extremely helpful in ensuring that our needs were taken care of in a timely fashion.  The price was the most reasonable that we could find.  Everything else that we looked at online and had family personally scout out for us was overpriced and low quality.  The quality, cleanliness and customer service exceeded our expectations.  When we come back we are definetly staying here and I personally recommend this stay for anyone in Lagos looking for a great place to stay.",February 2012,,,wrote a review Mar 2012,"Memphis, Tennessee","['8 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]

THIS IS HOME AWAY FROM HOME.Great value for your money. LESS I forget they will pick   you up   from the airport free. My kids can not wait to visit AMARA SUITES AGAIN. ENJOY.

Clean and great service,"I was in Lagos for 10 days and really enjoyed my stay at Amarsuites.  The rooms are very clean and modern.
