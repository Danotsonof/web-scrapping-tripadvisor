Great food & pleasant staff,"Chesney was the first hotel I visited in Lagos & I must say I was very impressed from the door all the way to the rooms. Clean environment, very respectful, helpful & happy staff. The food was a plus especially the fried rice. Perfect wifi no business center coupon stuff like in other places!!!! Call it “service with a smile” see you again Cheney",August 2019,Traveled as a couple,,wrote a review Aug 2019,,"['5 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
Great place,"I stayed here in late November. The room was really nice, and the staff were super helpful. They allowed me to check in early, gave me a big, quiet room, advised me on transport, places to see, etc. They let me use their VIP lounge when I needed to make a business call and required high-speed internet. Also, the breakfast is huge and terrific. The location in Victoria Island is very convenient. You're close to the beach, to a pharmacy, grocery store, etc. Highly recommend it.",November 2018,,,wrote a review Nov 2018,"San Francisco, California","['8 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",50,[]
Still my best place in Lagos,"I will always go back to Chesney. Nice and neat place, wide variety of breakfast offering. Though the central AC was misbehaving in my room (the thermostat kept changing from what I chose to a lower temperature), so I had to switch it off, and I didn’t enjoy my sleep. Interestingly, I will still go back there when next in Lagos.",November 2018,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Nov 2018,"Ibadan, Nigeria","['39 contributions', '37 helpful votes']",40,[]

Lovely,Cozy and perfect if you are looking for that comforting homely feeling home brings. Nice bed and a pretty view. One of my favorite places. Oh. I must commend the food too. Taste is great and so is the delivery time. Just how I like,September 2018,Traveled solo,,wrote a review Sep 2018,,['1 contribution'],50,[]
Too local,The key card I was given had seen better days and had to be held together to fit into the slot on the door because it was splitting. Why they would let it get to this level and still hand it out to a guest beats me. The kitchen was noisy like a market place. There's no form of entertainment at all. Had to put my suitcase on the floor because there was no suitcase holder in the room. There was only one hanger in my room. Drinks at the restaurant are not chilled sufficiently and service takes too long. No bar! Buffet served daily for dinner but very local with not much choice if you're not into local cuisine. Ordered lamb chops. Was told they'll take 45 minutes. Went to my room to wait. Got a call 15 minutes later that lamb chops were out of stock. Got a pepper steak instead that,December 2017,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"Nairobi, Kenya","['226 contributions', '43 helpful votes']",30,[]
"Lovely Boutique in the heart of Victoria Island, Lagos","It's a lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Victoria Island. Had a nice time when I was in Lagos for business.

Just Perfect,"By now, we all know how I love and appreciate a good bed. This one was superb. So comfortable, so soft, so warm, so Mmmmm.  It's situated at the quiet end of Saka Tinubu. They've got excellent service, great food, the place is beautiful. I didn't even expect to find such a peaceful place around there. It's a bit more expensive though but it was worth it.  The next time you are looking for a place around Victoria Island, try it.",July 2016,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Jul 2016,,"['57 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",50,[]

"Good room, very friendly staff, awful food","Good room, big desk for work, good bathroom, internet works very good at times and badly at others, exceptionally friendly staff, aircon did not work well the first night, but was immediately repaired when I complained, the only thing that really needs improvement is the food, I had the impression it is coming from take aways, but not sure, it is in any case very expensive and of low to poor quality, very unfortunate for a place I would otherwise gladly come back to esp considering other options in Lagos!",April 2016,,,wrote a review Apr 2016,"Zurich, Switzerland","['91 contributions', '71 helpful votes']",30,[]
"Great Place! Amazing Cuisine, Lovely","The serenity and the amazing customer service will surely blow you away. A cozy home away from home, and they pay special attention to every small need. A great vacation destination. The food is great and restaurant will go the worlds end to get you your preferred meal",October 2015,,,wrote a review Nov 2015,"Accra, Ghana",['2 contributions'],50,[]
An excellent boutique hotel in a great location in Victoria Island,"I stayed in Chesney for about 4 months in 2012 and have lodged there several times when I was a visitor to Lagos. Chesney is a great place to stay. The rooms are always impeccably cleaned, staff are nice and personal and their native food is awesome!  I have stayed in hotels for extended periods before. The usual experience is that you get tired of the place after a week and start looking for alternative dinning outside due to the monotony. But with Chesney I felt at home for the whole 4 months I stayed there.  If you are doing business in Victoria Island and you want a hotel close to offices, shopping, dining and clubbing on the Island. Then Chesney is your best choice.",December 2014,,,wrote a review Jun 2015,"Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria","['15 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",50,[]
Better than  I expected,"I needed 15 rooms blocked and when I heard this one hotel could do it, my initial thought was: ""no serious hotel will have that many rooms this side of town"". But I was happy to be wrong! staff are young and helpful. Rooms are comfy. My friend arrived on his birthday and they offered a nice cake to him.  I really appreciated that. And oh! The laundry service works 24/7  Vivian , Ali, Cecilia.. a great team indeed. They wear this buzzer-watch for service and clients can call, request bill or cancel call. Because they can give you a rebate, I will recommend this place.",May 2015,,,wrote a review May 2015,Abidjan,"['382 contributions', '103 helpful votes']",40,[]
Best of the Bunch,"We stayed in 3 hotels during my stay in Nigeria, 2 in Lagos.  The Regent Hotel and the Chesney.  Our stay at the Chesney was far better than our stay in the Regent.  They offered a good breakfast, free wi-fi (although connection wasn't always consistent), good water pressure and hot showers (which were not so easy to find), a full bathroom and a half bath in each room.  Very clean and relatively modern amenities.  Great service.  The only negative I had was they fumigation that they did while we were staying here was pretty unpleasant.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it for people traveling to Victoria Island.",June 2014,,,wrote a review Jun 2014,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",['5 contributions'],40,[]
"Great Hotel, Friendly Staff","This hotel is perfect for the business traveler. It is located within Victoria Island, one of the best places to live and work within Lagos. The hotel offers free WiFi, it's not that fast though but usable. The hotel staff are always friendly and happy to assist. The kitchen could however do with some improvement. Firstly, most of the foods in the breakfast buffet are too oily and they keep getting finished. Secondly, there always seem to be insufficient utensils. Sometimes there are no bowls for cereals, no plates for the buffet, no forks and knives on the tables etc. You almost always have to ask the waiters to bring you the utensils or cutlery. Apart from that, Chesney is a great place to stay.",June 2013,,,wrote a review Jun 2013,"Nairobi, Kenya","['13 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",40,[]
Excelent for 260usd,"This is a clean Oasis in the heart of Victoria Island, I came for business and stayed for a week. Very clean, very quiet, centric, nice decoration, perfect matrix, pillows, bath tube that you can really use, hanged flat TV, proper table to work, the internet works properly!, safe in your room, etc, all you expect for it price that really worth. You really wont feel in lagos. P.S. good quality full breakfast is included, but meals  (30-40 usd), however there are a few restaurants walking from the hotel and a big chain supermarket.",May 2013,,,wrote a review May 2013,"Mexico City, Mexico","['62 contributions', '11 helpful votes']",50,[]

Clean and Comfy,"Stayed here for an afternoon while on a trip to Nigeria for work. Never stayed the night but the rooms are fantastic and the place is very very chilled out. The staff who takes your bags to your room don't expect a tip like most places. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at, and defo the best hotel I've stayed while in Lagos",June 2012,,,wrote a review Jul 2012,"Inverurie, United Kingdom","['59 contributions', '18 helpful votes']",40,[]

Visitor Friendly hotel,"One of the friendliest hotels I have come across in a while. The staff are courteous and have a big smile at all times and ever willing to serve even at odd hours. The food is good, the breakfast buffet has a nice mix of continental and local cuisine and the rooms are comfortable, cosy and clean. Due to space constraints the pool and gym are small and serve more to say they have the facilities rather than serve the purpose. An excellent place to stay in Victoria Island where hotel rates are exorbitant. There is adequate place for parking and security is good.",November 2011,,,wrote a review Jan 2012,"Chennai (Madras), India","['69 contributions', '32 helpful votes']",50,[]
Best Experience in a long while,"From the reception to the room service, every thing here had a touch of class. The staff were accommodating and very friendly and were on hand to make the guest feel at home. I love the food and the bar is filled with exotic drinks. The rooms are spacious and well lit and enough room for my kids. Best part is that the service is incomparable. I would definitely be going back there.",August 2011,,,wrote a review Nov 2011,"London, England, United Kingdom","['2 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",50,[]
