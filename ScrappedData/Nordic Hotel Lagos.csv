What is the secret?,"This hotel, on Tripadvisor, has got so far only good reviews. Let us first clear any suspicion of cheating. Most reviews showed good and sincere-looking reasons for the enthusiasm.  In this human-sized hotel in the middle of Lagos, a certain idea of design can strike at first. There has been some hard thinking from the start. Lightning is ensured in small corners everywhere, convenient to have private conversations. Bookshelves dominate the reception areas, and the books are chosen for good reasons. The works of Andersen (of 'Ugly Duckling' fame) and Kierkegaard (a Danish theologian and philosopher, into Christian love and single indivudals, for short) are well represented. There are also both a Kierkegaard and an Andersen suites, for good measure. Effectively, 'we design",August 2023,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2023,"London, United Kingdom","['592 contributions', '202 helpful votes']",50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50']"

Cosy & Good chic place!,"Great diner, waitress Tobie very professional and attentive. Asked questions. Restaurant service in the evening really fast and well served.

Blown away!! 10/10!!!!,"Omg, where do I even start. From the moment we entered the premises, we were blown away! Upon entering we were greeted with refreshments from Favour which I must say, for the entire week, she made our experience so pleasurable! Aside from Favour, there was not a single staff that I can say that was unfriendly or unhelpful. I‚Äôve decided that whenever I visit Nigeria, I MUST stay at Nordic Hotel. Honestly a 10/10 spot. Rooms and bathrooms (my biggest concern) were so clean and breakfast options were really nice too! I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough!!!!

Perfect Hotel in the Heart of Lagos,"I am often too lazy to write a review, or I decide I want to keep the hidden gems to myself, but in this instance I will do the right thing.  The Nordic Hotel is brand new and this means it is absolutely immaculate.  The rooms are really comfortable (decent bed linen and mattress which is often lacking), sparkling clean and very peaceful.  The pool area is really pretty and very quiet, which is surprising given its location right in the heart of VI.  The staff are all, without exception, extremely warm, friendly and polite.  Nothing is too much trouble for them.  If they don‚Äôt know the answer to something they go and find out for you right away.  It is rare to find such good and genuine service.

A wonderful time at Nordic Hotel,"I love the ambience at Nordic Hotel. The modern/minimalist feel is appealing. I particularly love the swimming pool area designed like a mini resort. I like the fact that I am not stuck to my room all day. There are tons of books to read at the lobby, and there's the swimming pool area I can't get enough of. I hope they do not let the Lagos celebrity crowd turn it to a loud hub that would lose the tranquility it should protect. I hope they keep to a standard and brand theme. One of my favourite place at a hotel is the gym - treadmill especially, and it is available there. I enjoyed myself.

center of town - excellent place,Nordic hotel is a boutique hotel opened recently in Lagos. The hotel is very tastefully build and with quality at a standard unusual for Nigeria.

Service is higher than you will find in other hotels in Lagos - at a good standard. The acoustics provides for a relaxed environment allowing for nice conversation without stress from noice etc.  If you visit Lagos this location will be a great base for a stay in one of the fun cities of the African continent.,September 2021,,,wrote a review Sep 2021,"Lagos, Nigeria",['1 contribution'],50,[]
