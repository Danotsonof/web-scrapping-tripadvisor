Musky damp smell.. Nasty,So I booked my room ahead . Got there to check in and the room offered has a damp smell with bits of mould on the walls. I refused the room and they looked for another room. This time just before I got to the new room they sprayed it with airfreshner hoping to mask the smell. Even the weddings felt damp and a note on the bed saying they had just fumigated the rooms. They kept me there till almost 11pm saying they were looking for a room while the lady in front was quite rude!!. Its a shame though.

This is an OK guesthouse.. mediocre as a hotel,"I stayed here for a week on business. The check-in process took a while as the reception desk is small and if one or two people are checking in ahead of you be prepared for a 10 minute wait, my check-in when served was also slow.  The restaurant is small and serves a buffet of traditional nigerian food most days. The al la carte menu is reasonable and there are some wholesome dishes to be found. I checked in late and was hungry and the staff were helpful enough to allow to me eat in the restaurant late after the buffet had closed. The staff in the restaurant were all friendly and helpful.  The bedroom was of a hotel size and met many hotel standards one would expect. The bed was of a large size and there was a large wardrobe and desk. The room was cleaned nicely each day.

Très mauvais service,"I stayed in this hotel for almost two months. The first week, everything is fine, the service is okay. After that, it's another story, they forget your food order, or do not bring the correct plate, for my part, they took two days to repair my toilet, while I mentioned at the reception, same for air conditioning which took two days too, I had to request another room for that night. When I left for another hotel, they claimed me 7000 Naira, while I paid every days. I request for the ticket I'd sign and they bring me ticket from the past mouth which I already paid.  Because I did not want to paid, they closed the main door not letting me out, I was like in jail. After 30 minutes, they came back to me, asking for 2000 Naira.

Avoid this hotel.,"I decided to stay here as I just wanted to be near the airport for one night and wanted to try somewhere new. This place had some really good reviews so I thought I’d give it a try.  Firstly this hotel is difficult to find. My driver had to call them to ask for directions. There’s no signs on the exterior. No signs on the gate, above the door, you can’t tell it’s a hotel unless you have reception actually on the phone directing you.  Very hot and stuffy inside, no a/c in the lobby or public areas. A/c in my room did work but was not on when I checked in and it took 12 hours or so to cool the room down to a comfortable temperature (I’m British though so I like it cool to be able to sleep).  The rooms are very tired and dilapidated. Not clean at all. The windows didn’t close",May 2017,,,wrote a review May 2017,"Newcastle, United Kingdom","['77 contributions', '60 helpful votes']",10,[]

"nice people, convenient location, worn out","The people were great. The location is convenient for a quick overnight between flights, quite close to the airport to avoid the mythical traffic. Decent food in the restaurant (good Bitter Leaf soup). But the property is worn out, or at least the room I was in certainly was. Giant water stains and peeling paint on one wall. Rotted wood floorboards in front of the bathroom from some past water leak. Loose plumbing fixture. An incomplete electrical plate not quite covering up the wiring, and a loose receptacle in another. The toilet wasn't quite clean. And just for fun, the emergency exit diagram plaque which is on the back of every hotel room door in the world had fallen off, leaving a square pattern of old glue behind (I found the plaque itself leaning against a wall nearby).",May 2017,,,wrote a review May 2017,"Bremen, Germany","['130 contributions', '77 helpful votes']",30,[]

Last night in Lagos,"It was our last night in Lagos and we thus had to stay somewhere close to the aiport and The Sojourner seemed like the best choice. On arrival we were well welcomed from the lobby to the reception to our rooms. Room needs a little maintenance as there was a light not working and the toilet kept flowing which made the room sound as though it had a water feature. Wide selection of tasty breakfast.  Not sure if it was because of being spoilt by having home cooked food while in Abuja, which caused me to find the spicy goat a little bland.  Grounds were lovely with a nice seating area around the pool. Very scenic in the night with the lighting and couches. Would I stay there again?

Great for business,Stayed there for business for a few nights in March.  For Lagos standards absolutely superb with decent value for money offerings. Felt very safe which is an added bonus in Lagos.

The best undiscovered hotel in Lagos Mainland,I spent here night here in April 2015 because I had to be somewhere on Lagos Mainland and I didn't want the hassles of long morning commute.  I found Sojourner surprisingly pleasant. The hotel's well built and thoughts went into the rooms; I surveyed quite a few before settling down for a Classic Room on the fourth floor.  The price was pretty OK. $200 per night compared to another top brand hotel just 2 minutes drive away for $375 and not quite as nice. That's a story for another day.  The bed was pretty good and had clean sheets. Nice music softly played in the halls.  To the things that annoyed me - Room Service was horrible. They were so slow I felt my order won't be ready in a week. The order wasn't complete. Wifi was horrible.

Excellent Hotel,"I spent a night for the second time at The Sojourner by Genesis. Excellent reception from the gate to the room. Nice decor, beautiful environment, exquisite poolside. Will stay there on my next visit to Lagos.",March 2015,,,wrote a review Mar 2015,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria","['6 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",50,[]
Good,"Stayed here severally, had just one bad experience with their service, food was delayed although they apologized, their staffs are polite and friendly. my stay was pleasant. Not my best hotel but will definitely re-visit when next in town",November 2014,,,wrote a review Dec 2014,"Lagos, Nigeria","['18 contributions', '22 helpful votes']",30,[]
I doubt if I ever go again!,"Got the opportunity to stay in this place for the 1st time during my business traveling and the experience I got kept me away from adding this place into my wish list. I found that hotel room is very small, Wi-Fi connection is bad, linen were not proper and taps has murky water all through - out the day. Room service for a simple “Fish and Chips” took over 45 minutes to deliver, so I refused. The steward insisted that I should take it so had no option, but to have it in the restaurant. Once I saw it, I lost my appetite as that was the worst “Fish and Chips” I saw in my entire life! While I was having breakfast had another experience of been served with a dirty glass. All experience above was enough to make my final call.",February 2014,,,wrote a review Nov 2014,"Kelaniya, Sri Lanka","['367 contributions', '127 helpful votes']",20,[]

Nice surprise,"Have only stayed in this hotel once but plan to be staying more frequently when travelling through Lagos. The hotel was bright and airy with good friendly staff, nice rooms & decent bathrooms (compared to other hotels in Lagos), beds good but pillows were really soft. Nice bar & pool area where you can oredr drinks and bar food, I tried the club sandwich and would recomend it. I will be back and hopefully things will not have changed, the hotel was as good, if not better than a lot of other hotels I have used in other parts of the world.",October 2014,,,wrote a review Oct 2014,"Widnes, United Kingdom","['110 contributions', '47 helpful votes']",40,[]
Lovely surprise,"It was nice to discover this hotel in Ikeja after a very long day. Food was fabulous, had a Thai salad and roast chicken with sautéed vegetables and it was lovely. Bed was comfortable and after a good nights rest I was able to get up early enough and refreshed for my flight the next day.",October 2014,,,wrote a review Oct 2014,"Abuja, Nigeria","['43 contributions', '36 helpful votes']",40,[]
Good value for money - recommended,"First, the good points. Excellent gym. Quiet surroundings. A chef from Lebanon who not only really knows his business but is also a good tutor - the steak and chips I ordered was done precisely to my request and was, to be honest, one of the best steak and chips I have eaten anywhere in the world, Paris included. South African beef, you know. Free internet. And decent wine by the glass. So my personal requirements were all met. Bad points? A wake-up call at 6am instead of 8am, a chase for a borrowed item at 6am, a faulty shower with no effective drainage, noisy guests - not staff - and some food items that I would have liked, such as yoghurt, being unavailable, and a magnificent coffee machine not actually in use. But this is after all Nigeria, not the West, and it is remarkable",August 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,"Perth, Australia","['92 contributions', '160 helpful votes']",40,[]
Typical business hotel,"I only got to spend one night in the Genesis hotel, but It was a pleasant surprise. The rooms are modern, clean and fit the purpose. The bed was very comfortable. The restaurant serves a buffet (or a la card), which was simple but good.  The hotel consists of two blocks, split by a big swimmingpool. The pool area is connecting to the inside bar (via glassdoor), so one could have a 'cold one' outside or inside for that matter. During my stay some of the other guests got somewhat drunk and excited and started using (foul)language to address their friends/co-workers, which might be distrubing to other guests. Something the hotel might want to consider to look at.",August 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,"Nairobi, Kenya","['12 contributions', '13 helpful votes']",30,[]
Great ambience,"I hosted an event in this hotel for about 50 people. The check in was smooth, fast and efficient. The room was good, clean and soundproof which is a plus considering they had to use the generating set a lot. The conference facilities were ok but the area was understaffed as we had only one person seeing to the IT, coffee break etc. I would host another event here",May 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,"Lagos, Nigeria","['22 contributions', '14 helpful votes']",40,[]
The average hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sojourner for two nights. We made the decision to stay at this hotel as a weekend getaway and from driving past, it had an amazing ambience.   First, the rooms are beautiful and well designed. Loved the wallpapers above the bed posts.   Second, the bed is amazing. I thought I would get lost in it especially just after house keeping comes through.  Lastly, the buffet breakfast is just ok, nothing fantastic. What I think they need to do is get a proper chef that can add more variety to the menu in general because even the lunch wasn't fantastic.   The not so good part of the entire getaway was the fact that we always had to go order food downstairs because the intercom wasn't working. I noticed this within an hour of checking in and they said the",July 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,,"['19 contributions', '14 helpful votes']",30,[]
"Unfortunately, people were right about good quality only right after opening...","Returned to this hotel and now what I found was problems everywere... No hot water, leaks in the shower piping, water leaking under the shower box... All this indicates poor maintenance of the facility. Power outages are way more frequent and it is taking long to recover from them. Total disappointment.",July 2014,,,wrote a review Jul 2014,"Katy, Texas","['425 contributions', '205 helpful votes']",20,[]
What a pleasant surprise,"I wasnt expecting much when i got a reservation for this hotel, however the quality of service i received during my 3 day stay was excellent.The food was very nice and of good quality.   It is still a new property  and the staff were quite helpful. If you need to stay close to the Airport then this is the best place to be.",May 2014,,,wrote a review Jun 2014,"Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria","['19 contributions', '8 helpful votes']",50,[]
Its alright,"I noticed that the door guys were very helpful with the luggage. The front desk agents on the other hand should learn to smile no matter how stressful the job may be.  The atmosphere was serene, calm and relaxing. It wasn't in any way rowdy and that's good. On the downside though was that it didn't have any signage outside hence it was a bit difficult location save for the fact that we knew the number and the number was boldly written outside.  The buffet was 90% continental which did not go down well with my friend because he wanted to have a national dish. There should be more variety even though i noticed that a lot of the guests were expats.  Overall, its a place i would want to visit again.",March 2014,,,wrote a review Mar 2014,"Lagos, Nigeria","['341 contributions', '443 helpful votes']",30,[]
"Best option, so far","So far, the best hotel experience in Lagos. Hotel seems to be new, all furniture and rooms are in good state. Service is good and there is a restaurant at ground floor with decent food and proper service. People already told me it is of good quality only because it has recently opened. I hope they're wrong.
