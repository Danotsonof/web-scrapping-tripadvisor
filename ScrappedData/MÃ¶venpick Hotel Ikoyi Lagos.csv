Movenpick used to be Southern Sun,"Until recently, the Movenpick Lagos was known as a Southern Sun hotel because my airport pickup driver said he was from southern sun and even the GPS can switch name to southern sun when you are searching for Movenpick Lagos. The wifi and power supply are not great but this is the suppliers fault and the hotel is on the case. The hotel does have a generator that reliably kicks in within 30 seconds. Food is good.

Splendid experience,"Absolutely terrific dinner!   My first sea food dinner was really a beautiful experience and so I was excited to relish it once again  - there was a wide variety of delicious options to choose from.   Starting from the delicious Cat fish Pepper soup to a super gigantic grilled whole fish, the giant sized live on the grill prawns, calamari and white fish as well. There were even some mini pizzas to accompany it if you‚Äôre a pizza lover. They also had a great selection of sides like nutty rice, potatoes, rice, roast plantain on the grill, fresh veggies and salad to mention a few.  The Staff members who attended to me were extremely attentive and helpful. I had a swell time from 7 pm that I arrived, eating everything my stomach could take in.

A Brief Stay.,"I've always wanted to stay at this particular hotel for a good many number of years. The imposing building on Alfred Rewane Road was a structure I couldn't help but notice on numerous trips to Lagos. Besides, it's right next door to one of my all time favorite Chinese Restaurants in Nigeria. This is when it was known as Southern Sun. Was surprised to see that this enduring South African Hotel Chain had 'swapped' names, and it now a part of the Swiss M√∂venpick Hotel Group. Nevertheless, it would still remain on my bucket list of Lagos hotels to stay in. This year I finally got my wish and  booked a one day stay with my 2 teenage daughters on a short business trip. As I 'customarily' do, I'll divide this review into the positives and negatives based on my/our experience(s).",August 2023,Traveled with family,Perhaps the rooms on the lower floor would have aged less?

The restaurant is excellent with so much choice of high quality products whether you order from the carvery or the main menu you won't be disappointed.

Really great stay at M√∂venpick,"I stayed here for 3 weeks on a business trip. I have to say, this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in my 15 years of travelling. From security, waiters, reception, housecleaning, everyone is super friendly and helpful. The breakfast in the restaurant is phenomenal, management is always helpful.

Hard to hate; harder to love.,"At the end of a weeklong business trip, I want to be able to give this hotel a higher score.  In a city with few great business hotel options, perhaps it does stand out as a decent choice.  But when comparing to international standards ‚Äî  and even those of other African hubs like Nairobi, Kigali, Accra, or Abidjan ‚Äî Movenpick Ikoyi Lagos (and the city/country as a whole) comes up short.   There are a number of positives one can note about this property, including the friendliness of much of the staff, the well-equipped gym, the fast elevators, and the good location.  I also found the beds to be just to my liking ‚Äî firm, without overly hot duvets.   The towels seemed new and were plush and heavy.

Movenpick Ikoyi is a MUST!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the new Movenpick, Ikoyi. The staff were very professional; they were super helpful and friendly and were able to give advice regarding places to go and things to see, especially being our first time visiting Lagos! The buffet meals were delicious and had a spread of foods to satisfy ALL  different palates and meal requirements. The rooms were clean and the linen was good quality. The pool area was private and it was lovely to enjoy a cocktail in the shade, whilst the children swam. Security is always a concern, however I felt very safe and secure during my stay there.

A FINE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN MIX BUSINESS WITH LEISURE AND FEEL NO GUILT ABOUT IT,"Southern Sun Ikoyi ticks all the right boxes for me. Great location. Accessibility. Security. Beautiful Ambience. Culinary creativity. Well trained staffs naturally wired for hospitality.   Southern Sun Ikoyi makes my top 5 places for business meetings outside an office space. Fixing a meeting at SSI is one of my ways of making a statement that I mean business and I‚Äôm classy about it.   Socially responsible. As a sports tourism consultant, I‚Äôm personally impressed that a brand doesn‚Äôt own a golf course can sustain an annual corporate golf day for 8 years, among other CSR initiatives.",November 2021,,,wrote a review Feb 2022,,['1 contribution'],40,[]

The property is clean with a good security presence. I actually went back to the meeting room to pick up my phone during lunch break only to realise the venue was locked up by the hotel‚Äôs security officials who were also manning the door.

Excellent environment. Superb service!,"First stay at SS. Birthday weekend for my sister with all the family. Polite staff at check-in (despite payment hiccup due to network issues); v attentive staff at breakfast (on Day 2 they remembered my parents wanted lemon/ginger/honey without them having to ask and thanks to Kayode for promptly offering hot puff-puff ). Impressed about COVID-19 protocols at breakfast buffet as we were paranoid about having to touch general cutlery. Kudos to the hands-on F&B manager who doubled as a host and waiter (he also sent me back to wear my mask before entry). Our rooms were nice and clean. The a/c was very effective (excellent for Lagos). However, when we asked for extra duvets, housekeeping said there weren‚Äôt any but provided extra sheets as a sub.

The nicest staff,"I was here for a writers festival in October 2019. All of the staff members were very welcoming and helpful. They made it easy for us to get settled in and, each day, get to the festival venue a few blocks down. The food was great and with so many writers talking and drinking well into the night, it was wonderful to see how welcome we were and how attentive staff remained. When they ran out of irons and ironing boards, I had to send a dress to the laundry for ironing late in the evening and worried that it would not be done the next morning. I was very happy to get it on time and perfectly pressed! The hotel was very clean. Some of the rooms could use a little refreshing, but overall I was pleased with my stay and how we were received,",October 2019,,,,,[],50,[]
Fairly average Nigerian hotel experience,"Fairly average Nigerian hotel experience. The rooms were too pricey for the quality therein. One staff was rude to the point other guests were staring.

Weekend Stay,"My wife and I arrived at the hotel late Friday afternoon and well received at the entrance and immediately attended to by very cheerful Reception Staff and whisked up to our room on the 9th floor without any fuss. The room was really beautiful which, we were later advised by the General Manager, (Mark) had recently been upgraded as had all rooms in the Hotel. The room furnishings were top-class with a collection of Nigerian artwork and books of interest. In the evening we had cocktails in the popular Main Bar, on the ground floor before dining on the Terrace outside next to the pool - a great setting which is adjacent to the Main Dining room where we enjoyed a lazy, late breakfast in the morning.

The doorman is friendly. The small pool is especially refreshing after a session in the gym. It's quite central and well known, so whenever you book an uber, it's easy to locate your position.

As a businessman I found the hotel as a perfect fit. The management is of the highest quality that I have ever dealt with in my 25 years of travel on all continents. The example they set flows over to the rest of the staff. The facilities are very well maintained and the newly refurbished rooms are of very high standard. It can compare to anywhere in the world.

Sunday lunch buffet,"It‚Äôs been close to two years I last visited this place and boy was I in for a pleasant surprise.

The room was spacious and comfortable although some furnishings and fittings shows signs of wear and tear. Good wifi connection all through the hotel. I had lunch at the restaurant and the food is freshly prepared from the a la carte menu. I had the chicken curry with basmati rice and it was delicious.

Worth it‚Äô,"I am a frequent world traveler and have stayed in many choice properties across the world - Europe, Asia, US, Middle East & Africa.  I have had the pleasure of staying at the Southern Sun on four different occasions. My satisfaction level increasing with each stay, so much so I term my stay there ‚Äòhome away from home‚Äô. I have found warm and genuinely keen to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The food tasty, breakfast has a wide selection. The rooms, although in need of an uplift, clean and with the necessary amenities. The gym very good.  Shout out to all the staff especially William at the bar who makes some of the most amazing cocktails; Samuel the restaurant manager and his team, excellent service; and Bimpe and the entire reception team.

It is conveniently located on Victoria Island, with a decent feeling of privacy, despite being just off a major thoroughfare.  The food selection at the buffet is quite nice, but beware of the price of the buffet dinner - if you are not after sampling multiple dishes, a simple meal order might make more sense.

The hotel in Lagos where I always feel welcome,"Since February 2017 I've traveled to Lagos a number of times for business and I've stayed in the Southern Sun Ikoyi Hotel for many days, actually weeks.  Today I conclude another business trip to this city. I can say that this hotel has always been a reliable choice and I am very satisfied with the service delivery. The hotel management and the staff have always shown me nothing but broad smiles, professionalism, courtesy and warmth. Even when I was, once or twice, that irritated guest, not once did they shy away from their responsibilities and commitments. It's actually great to hear them say ""Have a nice day"" and I actually sense the sincerity in their voices. The restaurant and the food on the menu is good.

Better Experience,"This was my 2nd time staying at the hotel; my 1st experience was not the best but I decided to give it a 2nd chance and I can say that I was not disappointed.  Funny thing is that they actually put me in the same room I had issues with on my 1st stay (Room 321).  It looks like they actually took my advise and worked on the problems of the room ,smell and the noisy AC.  The room service was good, the room was clean and the bathroom was clean which is usually the most important for me.  Just a little nitpick though...I wish the receptionist paid a little bit more attention to you when giving service.  But overall, I was happy.  I will be back there in May for my stay.",March 2018,,,wrote a review Mar 2018,"Lagos, Nigeria","['3 contributions', '5 helpful votes']",40,[]

Delightful Experience,"For a wheelchair user, The Paraplegic room bath room was very okay but please put towels and accessories on lower levels, to allow wheelchair users more easy access.

You can use mattresses with auto adjusters. The Phone should be moved to the left side and another on the table and inside the bathroom.

A Fantastic Weekend Beach House Package at Southern Sun Ikoyi,"I stayed at Southern Sun Ikoyi this weekend and got to experience services by the hotel which were new to me. It was  well beyond the excellent food we have come to associate Southern Sun Ikoyi with. This special weekend package included a boat trip via Fiki Marina to a prestigious beach house at ilashe. The boat cruise and time spent at the beach house were exceptional. On Sunday morning, the weekend treat was topped up with a special visit to Oasis spa (a couple of blocks from the hotel) for an amazing full body massage. Absolutely wonderful. I had no idea a weekend in the Lagos I live in daily could be even more fun. It was a brilliant weekend and Southern Sun Staff were the perfect host.

Love this hotel,"First and foremost the pictures don't do this hotel any justice!! The pictures are old and outdated. Before I go to any hotel I alway use TripAdvisor for my final decision. I first judge by the pictures but was confused why it was $200+ a night and the rooms look old and over used. So I tried my luck and just booked for a night and to see what it looks likes. When you arrive you're quickly greeted by hostess. They take your bag and try to check u in as smoothly as possible. I got in about 8pm so I wanted to have dinner downstairs and I asked the hostess what are the choices. She politely told me either buffet style or I can pick from the menu. Well since in my next life I'm fat, of course I picked the buffet (haha) food was AMAZING. And I finished everything lol.

It is good I gave them a 2nd chance,When I arrived there 1st time there was 10 pm and power shortage. Elevators worked (own power generators) but nothing else including reception (and PCs there). It was disaster. Receptionist asked me (and other guests) to wait until we have electricity. I received a bottle of water but after 45 min I started thinking ‚Äì what will happen if electricity is back in the morning? I had to leave the hotel at 4:00 am due to early domestic flight so I had literally max. 5 hours. Eventually a receptionist woke me up at the reception chair and told me I can go to my room and once electricity is back they will give me a key-card (it didn‚Äôt work as it couldn‚Äôt be setup electronically due to lack of electricity).

Hotel of International standard,"Well located hotel that offers an excellent stay in a busy city.

Courteous and helpful staff especially the porters and the staff in the dining room. Breakfast offered an excellent choice and we experimented with combing various foods, this was fun. The dinner buffet was value for money and very welcome on the few days that we had our dinner in the hotel. I liked the wide range of seating areas dotted around for one to meet with visitors.  We stayed in an executive double room and our daughter in a standard room. Both rooms were very well presented and kept impeccably clean.

The breakfast menu was also very wide in variety and I found that I did not need to each lunch on most days due to heaviness of the breakfast meal. The hotel location was great and I found I could access most places with ease via Uber which was very reliable.

I have stayed a couple of times in recent months and found the customer service to be fantastic on both visits.  The rooms and buffet breakfast are also of a good quality.

Best Buffet in town!!!,"I visited the hotel twice for lunch and at both times I enjoyed  the services. The hotel offers nice food and beverages , the meals are continental with some Nigerian dishes.

Good rooms and good service,I enjoyed a one week stay. the rooms are very good. Service was good and the employees are warm and welcoming.

"Mildew floors, dirty bathroom upon arrival and rude staff","Many of the people who work here have been kind however many have also been rude.

At night the staff seem to become even more rude and unable to answer the phone when needed. The entire hotel smelled of mildew.  It smells like there has been a water leak and it has begun to rot the walls and carpet. The food is ok. I will not be back to this hotel.

The gym always had a trainer around to assist with the various machine and also provided great fitness advice.

While the room was properly serviced every day, several things were not provided such as shampoo and soap. The tea box was replenished every other day or even more. Little things but they do count. Quite disappointing if you wanted to make tea and find out that there was none. Breakfast is quite good but fresh juices are not always available, again every second or third day.

That and having purchased a large supply of the world‚Äôs most expensive Imodium allowed me to function, but only just. The staff knows about this problem: my request for a new room surprised nobody.

Mama's day Sunday Brunch,"Mother's day was May 8th 2016 and Southern Sun Ikoyi rolled out the carpet for mums like me and it was unexciting, 'spoil me' time. My two teenage daughters and husband joined me in what we all agree was a feast of a buffet. The sheer variety and creative options on the menu makes the cliche 'spoilt for choice' ring true. Ambience was warm and almost festive as it was a full house. The waiters and chefs on duty were tolerant of my nosy culinary questions around my chosen meal, making it a day to learn new things too. Like how i could actually use our local spinach... UGWU, quite effectively in a noodle dish. As brunches go, the Southern Sun rates very high on my list.

One of the best in Lagos,"I always stay at this hotel on business trips. I've stayed here about 8 times. The best part about this hotel is THE BUFFET.

The food is wonderfully displayed with nice lighting. Lots of variety on the buffet - seafood, an assortment of desserts, an expansive salad bar, great hot dishes, good selection of sides, veggies, it's just amazing. Yes, the buffet is pricey but it's totally worth it. The rooms- some of the rooms are a bit on the small side, depends on which part of the hotel you're in.

The food prices are pretty expensive though so you can get more for your money by going to a neighbouring restaurant e.g Casa d'lydia which isn't too far away.

A very good hotel but some Middle management issues,A well known brand. I usually stay at the Southern sun when I am in South Africa and the brand lives up to its value proposition in terms of concept and delivery.  A bit more needs to be done to get middle management staff to understand that they should listen to their customers. I had to stop using the gym because customers do not have a voice.   I will not hold this against the hotel as I believe the issue is confined to the middle manager in charge of the gym.

The air conditioning wasn't very effective and was rather noisy and there was a door to an adjoining room which wasn't locked on my side so I had to block it with the desk.

It's courteous and friendly staff give you a home away from home feeling.  Especially impressive are the breakfast and dinner buffets.

Feeling frustrated,"Room smells terribly after pesticides, AC is so loud that you need earplugs. Don't want to touch the floor with my bare feet as the carpet seems to be Stone Age old and filthy.

Pricey but worth it,"I stayed for 5 days at Southern Sun Ikoyi in April 2015 and I just loved it.  Although the check in process took some time, I fell in love with my room as soon as I saw it. It was quite spacious and the colour combination gives a cosy atmosphere to the room. The room was clean and equipped with kettle, tv and mini fridge. I really like the complimentary speculoos biscuits as well. The bathroom was also large and clean and well lit.  The wifi is good with decent connection speed. The connection doesn‚Äôt drop and it was better than I expected.  Breakfast is excellent, with so so much to choose from. Not sure what else one could possibly ask for.

'Worn' and sewage smell ...,"Running a hotel in Lagos is not easy.  The Southern Sun reminds me on how hotels were in South Africa 20 years ago.  Service is good, but check in and out proces felt cumbersome.  The rooms felt worn and smelled of sewage as did the elevators.  Breakfast and buffet dinenr I would rate as average.

Room for improvement,Having spent 10 days in the hotel we saw the good and the bad. Good: food is largely western and usually very fresh. At times meals arrived without some of the ingredients: e.g. No fattoush on meditteranean plate. No plantains with Naija fish. Wines are overwhelmingly mediocre South African. There is far better on the market. Prices in the hotel are odd. A virgin fruit cocktail costs more than wine! Prices tend to be on the higher side. Staff are very friendly but not always very 'together' . If it isn't in the rule book they battle. Very little conceptual thinking. Rooms are bog standard Southern Sun but functional. We experienced water issues on 2 days. An apology letter is nice but really! Power via generator is good as is wifi.

Good but can do much better,"It was my home during a week long business trip. Check in was quick with an warm welcome, rooms are spacious and nice, good food (though room service menu is quite limited).. But the major problem was the AC. I just couldn't sleep for the first 2 nights as the AC was not working and it took them 3 complaints and a little more push to get my room changed. The ACs are put in a peculiar place and are old. So even if they work, the room takes unusually long to cool down yet the bed remains warm.

Comfortable and effective,This hotel is really aimed at the business traveller. The staff are friendly and efficient. The food is good and imaginative with both local and western flavours available.  The beds are particularly comfortable.  The traffic is noisy on the main road side and gors all night. They could be more generous with bottled water as you need to drink a lot to stay hydrated.  Lagos hotels in general are insanely expensive and this hotel is on the affordable side. This is my 4th visit.  Tip: do not book a standard room.

Next time....,"For three days of meetings, my company booked us a room in the Southern Sun Ikoyi. Main reason is that it's close to our office and traffic in Lagos is a serious problem. It was my second stay at a Southern Sun (first was in 2011, Dar es Salaam). And this hotel was nothing like Dar. The room was crampy, the bathroom even more. Biggest (and big is an understatement) issue was the A/C unit in the room. It was from the last century and it made more noise then my motorbike. But worst was, the amount of cold air was minimal. So, I had to make the choice of sleeping in a very noisy room, or a very hot room. I choose the last. Worse to find out, I could not open the windows. Which resulted in a hot room with a headache in the morning.  Also light problems in the bathroom bothered me.",February 2015,,,wrote a review Feb 2015,"Herent, Belgium","['280 contributions', '116 helpful votes']",20,[]

"Nice! Friendly staff, great food.",Enjoyed my stay at SS. The facilities were comfortable and well-maintained. I was surprised at their pool though... really tiny- but they are in an area of limited real estate so it is forgivable. Besides it's more of a business type hotel. Their breakfast buffet was really good and so were the other meals I sampled. There are a number of lounges for those who need peace and quiet to read or do some work.

I was surprised when we arrived that the security check at the entrance did not include checking under the car with a hand-held mirror (like some other top hotels in Lagos do).  We got to the hotel in the wee hours of the morning and check-in was not as fast as I would have liked, considering that Hubby had booked online already.

We loved our stay!,"My family and I spent one night at the Southern Sun Lagos for the holidays and we loved it! I was a bit weary after reading about the size of the rooms but I was pleasantly surprised when we got there. The rooms are standard sized and definitely at least 1.5x the size of a London hotel room. The bathrooms in the two rooms we booked were shower but very clean and big enough for us. The hotel staff were amazing, always smiling and very courteous. Breakfast was sumptuous and relatively cheap considering the value we got. They allowed late check out by 1pm at no cost to us.  The internet wifi was free, fast and reliable. DSTV, the cable TV had several channels to chose from and catered to our varied tastes.

The bed takes up most of the bedroom, barely giving you enough room to walk on the sides of it.   Its clean and modern, and outrageously expensive as per Lagos norms. I had a couple of problems with the room on the first day - the toilet wouldn't stop running and the A/C, despite making a lot of noise in a small room couldn't really cool it off.

Security is very visible inside the Hotel, but it did concern me that the gate guard did not use a mirror to check under cars as they entered the compound. Room wi-fi service is good, far more dependable than the room phone, which was virtually useless.  The operator actually used her own cell phone to make a local call when I was unable to make it on the room phone.

Enjoyable stay,"I visited the Southern Sun on two occasions, one in November 2013 and one in December of the same year. Both times where great, first of the staff are among if not the most, accommodating people I've met. Far more than other European countries I visited, on many occasions they unanticipated what I needed and provided it to me before I even asked. The rooms were large although quite humid, the internet was not of very good quality but for mail and browsing was ok, no way to skype talk though. The general facilities looked dated but well preserved, it also had a gym but I didn't try it.

Friday Sea Food Buffet is a must, it is eveything you want plus more, The snails, the prawns, hmm  Sunday Buffet best in lagos, it has a blend of African and Contiential at its best,   I have never stayed in the hotel but i always keep coming back for the food. Southern Sun is where you would go to to relax after a particlarly long day and you sure of quality service, good food and cold beers",October 2014,,,wrote a review Oct 2014,"Lagos, Nigeria","['2 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]

The facility is always clean and the machines are well maintained.  There is a good selection of weights, machines and cardio equipment (3 treadmills, 3 bikes, 2 elliptical machines).  Steam, sauna, and lockers are also available. The most memorable part of the gym are the 3 attendants (I believe their names are Hostraap, Mbom, and Tobenna).

Shower is nice. Restaurant staff takes away plates too frequently. Hotel room is not good enough for the amount of rental being charged - that's probably because of the hotel's location.

Breakfast is ok, normal and comparable for any other hotel worldwide.  But my one and biggest qualm I have of this hotel.

OK but over priced,"Stayed here for five nights on a business trip. First room was on the first floor with no view except a ventilation duct and a parapet wall so asked to be moved on the second night. Rooms are quite small and rather tired and in need of an upgrade. A/C just about worked but was incredibly noisy - rather like being in the cabin of an aircraft in flight. So, not a good night's sleep to be had. Bathroom quite good but tiny. Staff generally helpful and friendly. Best thing about the hotel is the food - buffet breakfasts and dinner were outstandingly good, varied and utterly delicious. Beware the laundry - ¬£42 for three shirts, two trousers and a few bits of underwear.

"Nice hotel, awesome food","Moved to this hotel because I wasn't satisfied about my previous hotel (Moorhouse). The rooms are a little bit old fashioned, though overall very decent. The bed is comfortable, the shower is very nice, there's a hot water kettle and coffee/tea in the room. There's no free bottled water though, so you either have to go for boiling tap water or go for the way too expensive water bottle in your minibar. Also to be found in the room is a small safe and a large flatscreen TV with a fair choice of English TV channels. The airconditioner in the rooms is a bit older and can make quite a bit of noise although it does get the room cool. There is pretty much no noise from the outside to be heard in the room if you have a room on the back.

Your base in Lagos,It's a simply ok building (risk: your aircondition could be quite noisy!) - but the rooms are clean and there is not something not to like.

Worrying Signs,"As Lagos becomes more security conscious, safety was on my mind anyway.  I was therefore pretty alarmed when someone opened my door and tried to enter at 5am.  Fortunately I had placed the chain (bar) on the door, so he was unsuccessful.  I went to the door and there was someone in a porter's uniform outside.  I told him I didn't want anything (without opening the door) and he went away after a couple of minutes.  I phoned the operator and reported the incident and about 10 minutes later the night manager called to say the porter had gone to the wrong room so ""don't panic"".

At night, the bar is very quiet - mostly limited to expats watching a football game, and there are no grounds outside to speak of.    However, there are some excellent things if you do have access to local transport.  First, the Customer service can be outstanding.

Very secure grounds, walls/gates and plenty security staff. Excellent door/concierge staff. Reception staff also efficient and helpful. Lobby area, bar, restaurant all very clean, tidy, and welcoming with attentive staff. Bedroom of a good standard for decent hotel - good bed, nice bathroom, quite spacious, good aircon. Had most meals in the hotel - buffet style and al a carte, good choice, good standard. Hotel wide wifi which was fast and reliable. Location was pretty good for my needs - not bad for the airport, reasonable for downtown - crazy traffic aside - but the hotel can't control that - unfortunately!

One of the few expensive options available in Lagos you can still go for,"Hotels in Lagos are generally expensive and it's difficult to get a decent room for less than 300 usd per night, due to its location , southern sun is a preferred choice for business travellers. The staff is generally courteous and hospitable however sometimes you feel that price you pay is more than the value you get but that is the case with most other hotels available in Lagos",December 2012,,,wrote a review Feb 2013,"Lagos, Nigeria","['114 contributions', '60 helpful votes']",30,[]
Excellent service experience at The Southern Sun Ikoyi Lagos,"I've been staying at the Southern Sun Ikoyi, Lagos each time I travel to Nigeria for a few years now. I wish to commend the Hotel staff for the good service and the special interest they take in their guests. I've not had  any reason to complain so far.

Excellent services at Southern Sun Ikoyi Hotel,"From beginning to end, the experience was an absolute joy. The room i stayed in was clean, well stocked and relatively spacious. The staffs always had a smile and were extremely helpful. The breakfast (included) was the perfect fuel for a day traversing this hectic city. Its location is ideal to explore the city without having to reside right in the thick of it.  Not many four star hotels in Lagos offer free wireless services to guest and i guess it was the hotel's way of adding value. It was a great experience staying at Southern Sun Hotel and one hopes to repeat it very soon. All the staff gave that little bit extra and left me with lasting memories .",November 2012,,,wrote a review Jan 2013,Lagos,['5 contributions'],50,[]
Business meeting at the Southern Sun Hotel,"Having a business meeting at the Southern Sun Hotel is comparable to any of the meetings I have held in most five star hotels in Europe. The recent meeting of the Arbitration Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, Nigerian National Committee which was held at the Southern Sun Hotel is a good case in point. The arrangement of the meeting room was excellent and very gorgeous. The snacks supplied were different, delicious and suitable for the meeting. Attendees were very happy and impressed, with everyone saying that the ICC Arbitration Commission meeting has been taken to another level.  This is clearly one of my favorite hotels in Nigeria.

Staying at the Southern Sun Ikoyi Lagos,"As a regular client of SS, I was until this weekend a huge fan of your breakfast and weekend brunches having enjoyed numerous culinary delights with your array of food/dishes and choices since my return to Nigeria in the last year and more. Your chef should truly be commended as he and his team have kept these meals interesting, tasty, filled with variety while keeping it fun.  However, my weekend stay has allowed me the opportunity to enjoy your accommodation on a different level and also experience your room service.  I was impressed with the professional friendliness of the room service desk who were knowledgeable and accommodating to my breakfast in bed order but also encouraged me to try breakfast downstairs at the restaurant.

A good option for a business traveler in Lagos,"This is my third hotel in Lagos in about three years and, even though there is nothing particularly noticeable about it, the overall experience at the Southern Sun is a positive one, which is certainly an achievement in this city. Yes, it's expensive for what it is, the pool is tucked between the all day restaurant and the drop off area, the rooms are only average, the views are nothing special and it generally feels like it needs help but on the other hand, the staff is very positive and helpful, the restaurant has an amazing buffet, the security is very efficient, the business center is in order and above all, it really feels like a well run business hub.

Jennifer Meke and Simeon Odegor among other staff members really make my stay at Souther Sun worth it. People pay attention to what I need and are always eager to help out.

After being told that no one is ever on time in Lagos, the function room was fantastic and prepared way ahead of time giving us ample time to get ready for our event. The accommodation service was simply divine and was topped off with a cake to celebrate my birthday - a nice little touch that warmed my heart.

High quality service,"Expensive, but clean, safe and comfortable.  Service was excellent - all staff were friendly, polite and helpful.  Clearly there has been some very good customer service training.  Some nice small things, like getting a cold drink when you check in and some water when you leave.  Rooms are small, but pleasant enough.  Wireless worked most of the time.  It is on its own system, so it would stay on even when the main power cut out.  Restaurant food was mediocre, but better than you usually get for hotels in Nigeria.  Bar was comfortable, but the bar staff could use some training - one couldn't manage a rum and coke.

First - excellent wifi - had recently been in a hotel in London whose wifi was not as strong or as reliable as what I experienced at Southern Sun.

Awesome,"Awesome! is how I can describe this hotel. From the moment you walk into the lobby to the time you check out, you sense the warmth in the hotel's staff. They all seem eager to know how your stay at the hotel was... which really makes you feel cared for. Housekeeping, room service and any requests made is handled with exceptional speed... someone knocks on your door the moment you put the hotel's phone receiver down... talk of efficiency!!!

Good rooms small lobby,"Stay at this hotel when in Lagos and enjoy it very much.  It is expensive, but all good ones are in Lagos.  No fuss lobby does not make for an ideal business meeting location, and the hotel also has no conference facilities.  Other than that the lobby bar and the restaurant have a intimate feeling to them, with the limited seating in the lobby area often causing some congestion.  Wifi offered throughout the building, but power outages and line problems cause intermittent connectivity issues from time to time.  Staff are generally friendly and competent.  Rooms are small but comfortable.  Food is always good if buffets are your thing.

Good hotel,Was visiting Lagos on business and Southern Sun was the perfect choice for a hotel. The only downside was that the rooms facing the front can get a bit noisy from the traffic outside. This was wasily solved by a change of room which staff were more than happy to organise for me. Power blackouts happened often but then again this can be a common occurrence in many other parts of the world too. Southern Sun have a generator to counter this problem.

One of the best hotels in Nigeria that I have stayed in!,My third stay here and once again an excellent stay!  Management give it that personal touch and take guest seriously by going out their way to make you feel at home. Feedback is always well received and staff helpful and friendly.  Hotel is modern and clean with typical African hospitality. Food is always good and a variety is offered as all Southern Sun hotels. The bar is always buzzing in the evening and the free snacks always welcome.  Some of the rooms are a little dark and dreary so recommend a higher room but have not yet succeeded in getting one of the recommended room numbers!

This must be the best hotel Lagos currently has suiting the needs of business travellers. The check in was handled quite efficiently. The rooms are quiet, clean and new, quite spacious.

If you're working in Lagos this is perfect,"Lagos is one slightly mad, chaotic and unpredictable place. Its also one humming city always on the hustle.  The Southern Sun, if you're only in town for a few days & especially if you're working, is the one place to head to. In comparision to the competition its very good, everything runs like clockwork & the staff are all really helpful.   The only negative is that its packed with oil, gas & telecoms people all too scared to venture out without the armour-plated 4x4. The consequence is that they're all in the bar. If you do a regular job like Marketing or Advertising where you're much closer to reality you might find this a bit claustrophobic. Having said that I'll be back again soon.",December 2010,,,wrote a review Dec 2010,"Greater London, United Kingdom","['39 contributions', '56 helpful votes']",40,[]

A breath of fresh air when choosing a hotel in Lagos,"After living in Lagos for 30 years plus, and having to accommodate our overseas Clients visiting on business, I am well aware of the inadequacies and problems that prevail in most of the hotels in Lagos. Therefore, having changed my location from Nigeria to UK this year and having to visit Lagos for the first time since leaving in March I was not looking forward to my stay in a hotel. However, fortunately I chose to stay at the Southern Sun Ikoyi Hotel which was just being opened when I left Nigeria. I was pleasantly suprised at the overall high quality of food, service, standard of the room, hygiene and security. It was like arriving at an oasis in the desert. The quality of the food is excellent and complemented with efficient friendly service.

Southern Sun Ikoyi - A breath of fresh air in Lagos!,I have stayed at the Southern Sun Ikoyi at least 3 - 4 times in the past 10 months; and consistently find a remarkable improvement in the service levels and quality of the rooms.

Beautiful and comfortable,"I stayed in hotel southern Sun at Lagos on short trip on three occassions from 26 August,2010 to 9 Sept,2010 in three different rooms. i was on a business trip to Lagos.The staff at the reception was very cordial and welcomed me with pleasent smiles. I was offered a welcome drink. The rooms were very comfortable. I liked the shower of the bathroom very much righ at the top of the head with bigger nozzel and force of water. The morning breakfast , which used to be complementary, had almost all the items for anybodys choice. The service aws prompt and available on your table. the girl at the counter in the traditinal Nigerian attire looked so beautiful and charming.

Business. Friendly. Business Friendly.,"I arrived at the hotel after an exhausing experience not being able to board my flight homw. Without a reservation I was quickly able to check in to a very nice comfortable room, The service level and friendliness of the hotel is very high. Rooms come with a nice full breakfast buffet and even as a buffet the service is fairly efficient and attentive. The room service as well is very punctual and comfortable which is great when you are traveling alone on business. There is a tiny, tiny pool but it is not in a very good location (i.e. too close to eating area so not very private). The gym is awesome and you can use the in house trainer staff.

"Expensive, but I don't know any better choice","Like a previous rewiever wrote, you would not accept this price/quality ratio in other capitals, however this is Lagos... I paid EUR 230 a night, which is roughly the same as I paid in Sheraton Ikeja three years ago but then with a much worse experience.   The decoration is very nice throughout, rooms are of good size and the breakfast buffet is fine. Internet connectivity was slow on the first day, but improved on day two. Contrary to the breakfast, the dinner buffet is a rip-off at USD 50 per person with questionable main dishes. Get a driver and go dine somewhere else!   The pool is very small and we never saw anyone use it. The view from the hotel room is an awful abandoned building that looks like it's been through civil war, but I guess I can't blame the hotel for the view",August 2010,,,wrote a review Aug 2010,"Brussels, Belgium","['7 contributions', '28 helpful votes']",40,[]
Lagos comfort,"I visit Lagos serveral times a year and have stayed at all the main hotels.  All have weaknesses.  Six months ago, I noticed a new hotel just opened, the Southern Sun Ikoyi.  I was shown the facilities and have now stayed at the hotel twice for about a week each time.  The Southern Sun is a step up for Lagos accommodation.  It is a very well run, four star level hotel.  A mainly modern high rise design, it has all the facilities travellers need:  a siimple, but comfortable room with a great shower, a roomy, open foyer, restaurant and bar area, business centre and gym.  the restaurant has a range of Nigerian and Western food.  The bar is well stocked and has good snack food.  Above all, the hotel is clean and everything works - not always the case in Lagos hotels.

Good standard at this new hotel,"What a wonderful relief to at last find a good business hotel in Lagos. Obvious attention to detail and a visible GM who appeared genuinely interested in his guests. Appreciated in a city that can be indifferent to standards and service. A very good standard maintained throughout this new hotel, cleanliness and safety unmatched.

"This Place Is a Rip-Off, Even For Nigeria!","I have been fortunate to have travelled extensively throughout Africa for my employer. I have visited Nigeria several times, but this was the first time that I had stayed at the Southern Suns.  Although twice as expensive as the hotel that I usually stay at, we had been advised by our security personnel that it was better to stay in town rather than out at our usual spot on Victoria Island.  The service levels were apparent almost upon arrival. The reception staff were surly, to say the least. No welcome, just ""Where's your passport?"". I get up to my room, and find that the usual coffee, sugar and milk for the morning coffee had not been replenished since the previous occupant's stay. No bottled water, either.  Two calls to reception, and still they did not come to fix the",July 2010,,,wrote a review Jul 2010,United Kingdom,"['29 contributions', '17 helpful votes']",20,[]

A decent choice only because of grim alternatives,"By any objective standard, this is a medicocre hotel.  The food is OK, the rooms are fairly clean but very small, and the beds are not uncomfortable.  The prices here are absurdly expensive, but that's more about Nigeria than about this particular hotel.  The staff were friendly and always available, and the air conditioning worked most of the time.   Breakfast was the usual international standard of baked goods, fruit, eggs, etc.  Can't fault it really, but nothing was particularly good either.  The internet access was abominable, and most of the time was essentially useless.  For a business hotel that is absolutely unacceptable, and I would look for an alternative if you need to have internet access.",July 2010,,,wrote a review Jul 2010,"Alameda, California","['27 contributions', '17 helpful votes']",30,[]
"Clean, safe and very comfortable","For a first visit to Lagos, we wnated somewhere that would provide a level of comfort to make a 3 to 4 week stay bearable......... the Souther Sun proved the correct choice.  The hotel itself is VERY well maintained and cleanliness cannot be faulted.  The staff are very attentive and professional, and the general feeling of being in a very well run hotel is evident in all facets.  The restaurant provides a comprehensive and vaired selction for all meal times as well as various snacks and lighter meals available from the bar.  Rooms are modern, well equipped and comfortable - the only downside being the noisy aircon units as reported in other reviews.

What a pleasure,"Stayed at the Southrn Sun Ikoyi for the first time.  Without doubt i will stay there again when next I visit Lagos.  The staff are all very friendly, helpfull and well trained to do their jobs.  Even the security staff, provided by an external company, are vey friendly.  Visible management presence at all times.  The Hotel is new, modern design and attractive.  Whoever is in charge of housekeeping is doing a great job - this hotel is CLEAN.   Only one downside - they chose to install in-wall aircon units in the bedrooms.  In other words, you hear the compressor and working side of the unit so take your earplugs as the aircon is really noisey.  Good restaurant offering a buffet with great selection of local and international dishes.",May 2010,,,wrote a review May 2010,Singapore,"['5 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",50,[]
Dirtiest Swimming Pool Ever!,"This is the perfect place to go if you require to unwind in a dirty, grimy, slimy, green-visible-algae swimming pool. The changing room is under construction, so expect to shower in a toilet with a glass shower partition, flood the entire place and have the staff of the hotel bang incessantly on your door. Afterwards, walk all the way down a long corridor, past business conference and meeting rooms, to the gym and have a friendly attendant lead you through the back to the swimming pool.

One of the best things about Lagos,"In a city like Lagos it is important to stay at a nice, safe and clean hotel. This one ticks all those boxes. Of course, like all good things in Lagos, it comes at a hefty price. The breakfast buffet but not impressive. Why are there not more exotic fruits on African breakfast buffets? The check in/out was efficient and all service was very good. The room was very comfortable with all things you need, including a very comfortable bed.

A great hotel - Southern Sun Ikoyi,"Another quick visit to another popular Nigerian city ‚Äì Lagos. This time we checked into the Southern Sun Hotel formerly known as Ikoyi Hotel.   This hotel sits comfortably on the Kingsway Express Road but once you are inside you would never think that you are on such a busy road. The landscaped gardens within the grounds of the hotel plus the manicured lawns that surround the King palms on the main road, would make you believe temporarily that you are in California or Spain. The lobby area is grand and inviting and whilst you are being checked in, you are welcomed with a popular ‚ÄòNaija‚Äô drink known as ‚ÄòChapman‚Äô.  Delicious!

An expensive hotel that does offer good value for money,"This hotel is frightfully expensive, but in fairness offers reasonable  value for money when you take into account the excellent facilities, cleanliness and security. There were no power outages whilst I was there and there is wifi access. Public areas and toilets are immaculately clean and tidy and there is airconditioning throughout. There is secure gated car parking at the front of the hotel. I had an excellent sunday brunch in the restaurant and those few hours made my business stay very memorable, with absolutely world class food and ambience.
