DUMP...DO NOT STAY HERE many issues,"First thing to know, The photo images  are all form when they first built this hotel. A fact in Nigeria is that they do not maintain anything very well. Everything is old and falling apart.  The first thing is they have all the bed boxsprings directly on the tile floor and they put a dust ruffle over top of it, then the mattress is on top of that on the floor.   When housekeeping mops they slop a old dirty wet mob against the fabric at the bottom with the box Spring and it's soaking wet and smells.i it is very gross.  Next NEVER any hot water. If you let it run for a 10 to 25 minutes (which to me is a complete total waste of water), You might get a Luke warm temperature. Even if I turn off the air condition in the room it is still very cold to shower.  The pool looks nice but",May 2023,Traveled solo,I have traveled the world in many different type of hotels.

Don't Stay Here--Poor Hotel and Worse Customer Service,"I was charged 3 TIMES for the same room, with staff claiming their machine was not working.  I ultimately was charged 3x, and am now having to deal with my credit card to get a refund.  The hotel knows their mistake and they won't resolve it!!  Really terrible overall--WiFi dropped consistently making it impossible to work.

Value for money,"The hotel is in a good location and there is free wifi. Some of the rooms need updating. There is ALWAYS a delay when the facility switches over to the generator after a power cut which can be a tad irritating.  A good tip is to ask for a room on the 6th floor facing the Eko Atlantic development. The breakfast is not bad and the eggs quite good! The main saving grace of this hotel is its staff.

Nice and Comfortable in Lagos..,"Whilst on a business trip to Nigeria, the company had made reservations for me at the Avenue Suites Hotel on Victoria Island, the hotel is safe and secure and close to many venues in Lagos, Victoria Island itself is a nice pace to stay and with plenty bars and restaurants often frequented by expats mainly from the UK and other European countries. The hotel was comfortable, clean, the rooms however are looking a bit tired and if you ask for a non-smoking room, they don't exist ..I asked for a non-smoking room but the smell of smoking by previous clients is noticeable when you enter the room.. TV channels are limited, there is free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel.

"Food always on point, Internet is also reliable","I give 'The Avenue Suites' 4 stars because even though they have found a way to make certain that their food is on point and their Internet dependable, the Uptown shogun restaurant on the 6th floor managed to mix up my dinner request serving me chilli chicken and chips instead of chilli fish and chips. My key card also stopped working during my stay but they surpassed my expectations. The Manager and this other Lady were amazing as they offered me a drink on the house while I waited to get the door sorted. The Kamikaze cocktail was on the house and they fixed the door in little or no time. I would definitely recommend this hotel because of it's serenity as well.

Check-In was very fast and the room I had on the 6th floor has a wonderful view over Eko Atlantic City.  I also highly recommend the top floor restaurant.

Nice Suite,Spent one night at the Avenue Suites on a last minute personal booking after Blowfish Hotel and Hotel.com let me down on my previous booking. The rooms are large and comfortable with all the amenities you would expect to see in a 5 star Hotel. From the my third floor room I had a great view across the Victoria Island shorefront. The restaurant on the top floor also has large panoramic views and the food is very good. Service was good and the staff welcoming.

Rooms were cleans and tastefully furnished. Toiletries were provided. Breakfast is free for one only... but the breakfast wasnt nice throughout my stay.. same dishes.. and nothing spectacular.

The best hotel I stayed at during my recent visit to Nigeria,"While not a five star property, at best four or three plus plus in international comparison, this was the best hotel I stayed at while in Nigeria last month.  Check in was prompt, aided by having met the F&B manager earlier in the week who turned out to be a jack of all trades at the hotel and was at hand when I arrived, clearly in the capacity as Duty Manager. I therefore swiftly got into my room, necessary as an evening function required cleaning up and changing of clothes.  I only settled into the room when I got back from the evening out for my one night stay, took a few pictures and then settled down on the desk for a couple of hours of work.  The room I got on the third floor was spacious and clean, everything worked - unlike my previous hotel where bulbs needed changing",November 2017,,,wrote a review Dec 2017,"Kampala, Uganda","['3105 contributions', '496 helpful votes']",40,[]
Fairly Good,The Avenue suites is in a good location as it’s easy to access various establishments within Victoria island. It’s less than 5 minutes to Eko hotel.  It’s fair size with a Swiming pool and complimentary breakfast with booking. Clean environment and comfortable space and bed. However tv Channels were limited and not clear.  The staff appear nice and helpful as they attended to minor issues I had promptly.  I advice you take an extension cord or adaptor plug as one one socket is compatible with regular plugs.

"Solid Option, cramped bathroom","I have stayed at the place 2 times and both times were OK. Check in was a bit slow bc res was made via Ota, they weren't sure if I had prepaid etc. The rooms are starting to look worn, they crank the AC to counter the humidity. Food is solid, but on the pricey side. Although it's not anyore pricey than other places in Lag.  Hotel feels a bit cramped but the rooms are a good size. The toilet is very awkward tho.

Bad service,"This hotel is located in Victoria Island, with nearby market and restaurants, they offer breakfast, there is a restaurant in the hotel, there are a small pool and a tiny training room (not a gym), they gave me a discount on my stay and they have upgraded my room as a compliment from the management.  Now, let me explain the reason I gave it a poor rating: the room had a lot of broken things, and that is not even my issue, my issue is that I had to call 3-4 times on each broken thing to get it fixed, I had some cleanliness issues, and finally the worst thing was the attitude and behaviour of most employees, starting from the reception, maintenance, room service...etc, they were rude, challenging, and treated me like I don't know what I am talking about.

"Horrible Food, Worst I have tasted in VI, Lagos","I came on Val's day 14/2/17 to have dinner at the topmost restaurant at avenue suites. It has a nice view but that is where it ended. I ordered Singaporean noodles with shrimps and my wife chicken in mushroom sauce. The food took more than 45 mins to come out and it was tasteless. The noodles was hard, the sauce bland, the shrimps were like just 4 small pieces and loads of vegetables that was swimming in water. I could find water at the base of noodles. My wife's chicken was clearly stale and not tasty. The best part of the dish was the mashed potatoes, Imagine!!

Top-notch!,"The Avenue Suites is an edifice with class, style and panache. Centrally located to the best sights and sounds Lagos has got to offer ....specifically on Victoria Island. The bespoke rooms are spacious, with cossy beds and equipped with modern amenities.  The gymnasium even though is small in size still can boast of a state of the art facilities. The swimming pool which is strategically located at the back of the hotel is clean, well maintained and relaxing. My family and I stayed for 14 nights and I must confess we had a fabulous time. The front desk (reception) staff were friendly and always welcoming.

Great value hotel in Lagos,"I stayed here for 9 months, so I have seen it all - almost.  Positives:  Location was perfect for my business  The pool was excellent! Clean and deep. I like!  The ""Uptown"" restaurant had great food. I enjoyed the Chili goat meat and Chicken pizza.  The breakfast buffet was decent. For a non-Nigerian averse to trying new things, there will be limited options.  The staff were very friendly and were flexible to do almost anything- one just had to explain patiently and they accept tips like in the US.  Laundry service was great.

Strategically located. A poor breakfast.,"The location was perfect for all my business appointments. Slow internet. The buffet breakfast was poor and pretty much the same every singe day!! The food quality seemed questionable to me... The tiny pillows are a JOKE !!  The room didn't smell good. I guess that 2++ or 3 stars would suffice to rate this property right. But it's Nigeria, the standards are way different from Europe... No thrills, nothing at all to be impressed by, boring.

A good option in Lagos,"We are constantly looking for a good hotel in Lagos for our team, and the Avenue Suites presents a good alternative. We typically stay at the international chains, and all of them have their flaws. This is a much smaller hotel, and has the good and the bad of being a smaller hotel.  We were initially attracted to its newness - when we visited the first time, we were greeted by a blast of blessedly cool air when we walked in the building. This is no small thing - many of our choice hotels struggle with their climate control, and in a place that gets as hot and humid as Lagos, that really matters.

Very safe and good car park.   A bit annoying but there is no gym as it is being 'refurbished' but it has been like this on both times I have travelled there!   Really nice beds and good cleaners who do a great job!",August 2014,,,wrote a review Jan 2015,"London, United Kingdom","['64 contributions', '23 helpful votes']",40,[]
after trying 5 of the top hotels in Lagos,"i  personally stay there for 100 + nights per annum  and i bring along guests from Europe on regular basis , the best value for money if you have a corporate rate. you feel like at home on your second visit as most of the staff will make you feel at home and not as a guest . not more than 1% risk of unpleasant technical challenges  wifi always works very low turn over of employees which mean they treat their staff very well (satisfied staff => satisfied guest) simply great food at each and every meal i ever had there (quatro fromage pizza and pasta ,spinach ravioli , steaks , brucheta's , Sushi yes sushi in Nigeria is safe and great at this  hotel , goat cheese salad , panache salad the one with palmito) the list is wide and and great )  location is great if you would like to",October 2014,,,wrote a review Oct 2014,"London, United Kingdom","['12 contributions', '7 helpful votes']",50,[]
Average Hotel,"This is not the best hotel in Lagos for the price you pay, rooms are clean and tidy but that is where it ends. You cant see through the windows as the glazing has been damaged. Bathrooms has a shower tub with no door or shower curtain, lot of water ends up on the floor which is a slipping hazard when you step out. Biggest issue is the noise most of the time, you can hardly sleep if you go to bed early. The hotel is busy with renovations so I am sure it will greatly improve. Staff are great! Very professional and friendly all the time.",October 2014,,,wrote a review Oct 2014,"Centurion, South Africa","['12 contributions', '3 helpful votes']",30,[]
Exceeds expectations by all means,"Wonderful hotel in the heart of Victoria Island. Very safe location, which is the main reason why I chose to stay here. Everything was practically walking distance from the hotel. The room that I stayed in was modern and very spacious, with a lovely sea view of the harbour. Very clean and well maintained. I shouldn't forget to mention that their crepes are to die for! Hotel staff were very welcoming and courteous. Overall a pleasant experiance indeed.",April 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,"Melbourne, Australia","['9 contributions', '10 helpful votes']",50,[]

"If a 5 star hotel is what you're after, then that's exactly what you're going to get with this hotel.",Very pleased with my experience. Lovely location and hotel. Extremely helpful staff that were at our service promptly. Our room had a wonderful sea view and the staff were kind enough to offer complimentary breakfast due to a booking issue. Very spacious rooms as well. A big thumbs up!,July 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,"New York City, New York","['246 contributions', '129 helpful votes']",50,[]
Excellent hotel with a 5 star restaurant,I have stayed in Avenue till now 5 times ranging between 1 to 2 months per stay. The hotel rooms are clean. Breakfast is good and the restaurant is excellent. Location is good and near most of the big companies. So going for meetings within VI is easy.,May 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,South Africa,"['16 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
Nice but a Expensive Business Hotel,"We stayed for a night at the Avenue Suites on transit. Good business class hotel in Victoria Island and in a safe location. But USD 300+ per night is not worth it.. Rooms are clean but the toilet is to small. The restaurant ambiance is good but a pricey limited menu. Overall, it's a nice and safe hotel for a short stay.",July 2014,,,wrote a review Aug 2014,"Abuja, Nigeria","['25 contributions', '28 helpful votes']",50,[]

Great business hotel!!!,"I was apprehending when i was informed that i will be staying at Avenue Suite (always stayed at Southern Sun) but how surprised when i get there. Hotel is very well located (beach front), less traffic, great restaurants around (walking distance even if i didn't walk due to company security restrictions...). I didn't tried the hotel food only the breakfast and it was not interesting and didn't makes me curious about their food (and i also had bad comments from colleagues that tried). The room...spacious and well equiped (water boiling machine, coffee (some tea bags would have been great!!!! but no!), safe deposite box, mini bar. AC working very well and not noisy. the bed was ok i just regret that they only provide 2 pillows. The bathroom was also ok with (toothbrush and paste,",March 2014,,,wrote a review Mar 2014,"Dakar, Senegal","['8 contributions', '9 helpful votes']",40,[]
Exceptional,Stayed few times. Location and view of the city and harbour are nice specially form the Level 7 bar and lounge. Very clean and organized. It might have more space in the courtyard but still enough concerning Victoria Island.,March 2013,,,wrote a review Jan 2014,"Pula, Croatia","['1945 contributions', '145 helpful votes']",50,[]
10/10,"I had a very cute dinner for my fiancee's birthday here and everything was EXCELLENT!  The ambience was very good, calm atmosphere, soft music and friendly and courteous staff made it very worthwile.  The Chef was terrific! We kept getting very tasty meals. I recommend the SUSHI here to all sushi fans out there! Try it out for yourselves!  We got a birthday song played throughout the restaurant and a cute cake was served while she blew out the light on the candles! She loved it so much!  I will definately do sushi with my friends here in the next few days.  I highly recommend The Avenue Suites.",August 2013,,,wrote a review Aug 2013,"Orlando, Florida","['3 contributions', '1 helpful vote']",50,[]
Good location.,"Good points; Room was comfortable, clean and well equipped, wifi worked well, swimming pool clean, staff friendly and helpful, uptown restaurant very good.  Bad points, Breakfast is terrible, never the same twice, croissants warmed in a microwave, English breakfast with hot dogs, greasy eggs, canned mushrooms and cheap juice. Nice sea views but all the windows are 'blown' and filled with condensation. Had to ask everyday for tea things to be replenished. To the owner; Get the chef from Uptown to look at the breakfast menu and start again.",July 2013,,,wrote a review Jul 2013,"Bishop's Waltham, United Kingdom","['190 contributions', '80 helpful votes']",30,[]

Friendly Staff and Comfortable Rooms,"The staff at this hotel is very friendly and courteous. I was greeted by each person I saw from the moment I walked in the hotel to the moment I walked out. I was escorted up to my room and was surprised to see it so large and well-appointed. It seemed to be newly updated, so lots of nice finishes and comfortable furnishings. My only gripe is that the gym is located in a converted room (not labeled as the Gym), doesn't have working A/C, and the three machines it has (a cycle and 2 treadmills) are all in various states of poor performance. When you're not allowed to leave the premises without a driver, a nice gym would be a great diversion. The internet connection is fairly good, as well. I never had a problem accessing the internet, but Skyping would stall or drop my calls. I",June 2012,,,wrote a review Jul 2012,"Houston, TX",['3 contributions'],40,[]
Convenient and with lots of promise!,"This is a new hotel, only ""soft"" opened 1 month when I visited, but nearly everything is in place.  Good quality furniture and fittings, the room was large, modern and very comfortable with all the expected conveniences (including free wifi).  The restaurant upstairs is quite a stunning location, and was buzzing already.  Staff were more than happy to assist with everything.  Breakfast is ""set"" or you can option up, rather than a buffet, but with lots of fruit this was quite nice.   At the moment, like most hotels in Lagos, it is still an island between expat compounds and local housing, but it felt secure and professional, particularly for a solo traveller.",August 2011,,,wrote a review Aug 2011,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","['6 contributions', '6 helpful votes']",40,[]
