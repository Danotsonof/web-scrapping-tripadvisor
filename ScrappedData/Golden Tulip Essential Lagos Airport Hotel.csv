I wouldn't go back,"We stayed at this hotel because it is near the airport and I had an early flight to catch.   The staff who checked us in were friendly and the check in process was fairly quick. The room we stayed in was OK but was spoilt by the fact that room was quite dark and had very little natural light.   The food was OK but the layout of the dining room, the lack of natural light and the extremely hard to move chairs made the overall experience less pleasant.   The WI-Fi did not work and I kept on getting an error on my phone that says 'IP address cannot be found'. When I went to ask at the front desk, the man at the desk responded 'It is general', meaning everyone was experiencing the issue. When I insisted it needed to be resolved, he said he'd send and IT guy to the room to fix it.

Worst Check in ever,"I have been waiting in the lobby of this supposed 4* Hotel for the last 45 minutes. I have checked in but they only sent cleaners to clean my room when I arrived. They have asked me to wait in their lobby for almost an hour and everytime I ask when my room will be ready they tell me just a few minutes. The hotel isn't busy in the slightest and it is 8pm in the evening. Absolutely 0 excuse why my room should take almost an hour to get ready. I may end up sat here waiting for well over an hour. In the meantime they haven't even offered me a complimentary drink. I went to the bar to order a drink while I waited. They didn't have tonic, soda water or lemonade so in the end I just gave up and returned back to the lobby to carry on waiting.

Never Again!!!,"I  try to give allowances knowing how difficult it is to run a business in Nigeria however , I make no excuses for service issues . Coming from a red eye flight  my colleague and I walked into this establishment for one night because it was close to the airport and was an international brand .

The bedding was clean but obviously frayed and stained and the mattress was wood hard, you could jump on it and it would not budge .

Accomodable room,"This hotel is probably quite nice, however, did not enjoy this hotel.  Too many things going on, and everyone wanted their own way.  They had it.  I focused on what I could manage, which again is my sleep, my eating, and my little sister and cousin, when they chose to stay in one place.   My husband could check up on me when he could, but he was limited in his movements as well.  Thankful for my family as the three of them kept me sane, and the service of the waiter Benson.  For a country that is the most populous in Africa, to have a hotel adjacent to the airport, Golden Tulip worked to the best of their ability and served the people who should be in that hotel.

Nope,"The fact this hotel is ranked as high as it is is a shock to me. The front desk staff was the nicest thing about this property. Upon being “upgraded” to a suite. I arrived to my room 308....it only took 30 minutes to find as the elevator buttons and levels were misplaced. Guess they don’t maintain elevator inspections. My room number was missing from my room, making it very difficult to locate. Once I finally located it to I hoped how soon my stay would end.   The amount of continuous sound outside and inside this hotel makes it impossible to rest in this place. Very loud cars, music, people, street noises is heard 24/7.

Ideal for early airport departure,"Stayed here a few weeks ago whilst awaiting flight back to UK. The approach to the hotel does inspire much confidence and neither does the check in area. However, once I have gone up to the room I was pleasantly surprised. The food in the restaurant was fine and the bar had a reasonable selection.

Average,"This hotel is average at best. It's advantages are the close proximity to the airport , the buffet breakfast with local food which was good and big rooms . Unfortunately the beds are hard and the noise from the main Street is very bad up to late hours of the night and when changed to another room facing away from the street I was greeted by equally loud music from the swimming pool bar area which went on till late hours of the night.  The other parts that were bad are the rudeness of some of the staff members when anything is requested from them and the fact that the staff members ate from the breakfast buffet before and during the time guests are there and finish some of the items in that buffet and not add more leaving the buffet very limited.  All round it is an average hotel",October 2018,,,wrote a review Oct 2018,"Johannesburg, South Africa","['1112 contributions', '213 helpful votes']",30,[]

Restaurant: i served dinner and i orderd spaghetti carbonara i was thinking “here we go this will be interesting” when food came and i tasted it it was just great. Room: clean and nice bed sheets. Free internet little bit slow but ok. Bathroom: you have everything you need for a shower.  24 hours light witch is a plus. Thank you guys for a pleasent stay.

Best Place To Stay Close To The Airport And Town,"I was skeptical initial but thank God I listened to my guts. The place is a wonderful place filled with cheerful looking workers who are always on hand to help with any issue. Their food is excellent, the rooms I stayed in are so cozy, I stayed for 4 days and switched room twice. If you are a smoker, know that you can't smoke in the room, you will have to go down to the pool side which has a bar.  The place is the best place for corporate people. Environment is serene and calm.   To crown it all, the hotel is 5 minutes or less to the airport with drivers always on standby.",October 2017,,,wrote a review Oct 2017,"Little Switzerland, North Carolina","['3 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",50,[]
Not a bad place for non-smokers to spend the night before travelling,"This hotel is 5 minutes away from the airport, which makes it a good place to spend the night if you are afraid of being late to your flight, but be aware if you are a smoker, they don't have smoking rooms, you have to go down to the pool to smoke.  Based on the reviews I have read in here I asked for a room away from the street and they refused to give me one, they told me that all rooms on the other side are suits, and they told me that the windows are sound proof, but even though I was on the 4th floor I can still hear the cars on the street.  Overall it is not a bad place unless you are a smoker, they have a restaurant, a pool and a gym, the rooms are not bad, they have a little bit of attitude with me but I was having a bad day, and I gave them trouble so I can't really say",July 2017,,,wrote a review Sep 2017,"Amman, Jordan","['2211 contributions', '382 helpful votes']",30,[]
Close to Airport,"This hotel has been my usual stop between flights . It's exactly 5min from the airport. It's more of a mid level budget brand with the full size version located more into the centre.it provides essential service's which one would need during a layover. Room service ,pool etc are available. The condition of the rooms are average and the towels and bath related could do with replacement .overall no complaints due to its location. A special mention to the drivers at the hotel who are always proactive in picking /dropping customers around the clock. On account of flight delays,they are still active and coordinate pickups effectively .

No night clubs or bars, except in the hotel. My standard room was small, however it felt like a  romantic get-away for us.One of it's well kept secrets is the food in the IRUKA Restaurant.

Wonderful hotel,"I stayed in this hotel with my family in July 2016. We stayed in the Executive suite. It was very spacious, clean and up to date. Customer service was 100%. The restaurant downstairs was superb. We had complimentary breakfast- very delicious and a mixture of Nigerian/Western cuisine.

Fantastic,"Great hotel, stayed over the weekend from the 16th - 18th July, airport stopover, due to KLM cancelled flight. Room fantastic, the food out of this world, great shout out to the cook, please Golden Tulip hold on to her, she is worth her weight in gold, a sentiment shared by fellow stranded passenger. The duty manager over the weekend was lovely and did all she could to make us as comfortable as she could, would have given 5 stars but for a slight issue with the reception staff on checking in, I guess it's difficult to handle over 50 irate customers at 4am in the morning.

Close to the airport,"Very situated when GOING to the airport - getting there FROM the airport takes a lot longer. I found the room clean and comfortable enough, although on the first floor facing the road, there was a lot of noise from traffic. I couldn't understand why the windows weren't double-glazed. Wifi worked well enough and the buffet dinner was reasonable, though expensive at 5,000N. Visiting the gym was a waste of time, as everything was broken.

"nice hotel, not so nice services","It was my wedding in April 2016 and so I went in search of a hotel close to the venue. Without a doubt Golden Tulip was the best of the lot along that airport road. The rooms are clean and the air freshener is really nice. Their staff are friendly and make a decent effort even though it can be a whole lot better. Their management however is not so much to write home about. I'd booked a suite for my groomsmen and I and the room was empty in terms of extra perks you would expect in a suite. We had been assured of a roll in bed, but we didn't see so much as the rollers let alone the bed. My wife also had the same complain in her own suite on the floor below. The food downstairs was not great and the attitude of the staff in the dining area was not very heart warming.

Great hotel near airport just let down by transfer,"Stayed overnight waiting for an internal flight. Location is great but if you want to make use of the transfer which is free, make sure you have a local number!! I had to call a dozen times and waited ages. This was one of the main reasons for selecting this hotel but I think I would rather pay for a known cab to take me there next time.  Bar and restaurant were great although service not always there. Room was very comfortable, clean and pretty much everything worked.  I paid hotel but they were making a fuss about accepting USD smaller than 50s. So I would suggest you exchange money in the parallel market at airport and pay in Naira. Either that or risk your bank account and use plastic.

"Friendly staff, poor management","The hotel is conveniently located minutes away from the airport. The rooms are clean and well-appointed. The staff is friendly and does there best to accommodate your requests, however the hotel has some serious issues that may dissuade some guests. The rooms are appointed with an electrical panel that controls lights, tv, air conditioning, etc. and as there are very frequent electrical outages, the panel doesn't function well. You must wake up and reset the panel after every outage. The wifi does not work on upper floors although it does work well in the main lounge.
