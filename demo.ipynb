      "Review Text: For the past 5 years ive always stayed at the Eko main hotel. Ive noticed the deterioration of services and quality. More and more items are not available on the menus, even a simple pina colada from crossroads restaurant could not be made due to lack of ingredients. The room service menu is even worse- more than 50% of items are not available. Ive requested an iron to my room and had to wait 45 min before it arrived. Food is overpriced and quality greatly reduced- since Eko caters more and more for the masses it seems. This is no longer an exclusive hotel like before. Upon checkout I requested assistance with my luggage and decided to carry the suitcases myself after waiting for more than 35 minutes. My dissapointment has increased after each visit.\n",

Comfortable environment if you don't mind the the noise. The staff not markedly friendly but helpful. Food is average. One selling point is the poolside which looks quite captivating in the evenings.\n",

      "Review Text: This place is more a congress center than just  a hotel. It includes seminar rooms, huge conference rooms, hotel rooms and suites. Plus some other places under the same brand names, outside the main complex. We tried only a few of these facilities, when not at full capacity.  The architecture of the place seems designed to make it a versatile place. However, the result is a maze, that can turn quickly into a mess when crowded. Staff come in all shapes and froms, from the arrogant and disinterested to the genuinely concerned, competent and talented.\n",

      "Review Text: My husband and I booked Eko Hotel in November. We entered from the pedestrian gate after a walk and was demanded to provide ID to enter the grounds. For safety reasons we refused and called front desk. The front desk advised this was not protocol and this security was not acting in accordance with policy. Regardless, he refused to allow us in and proceeded to physically attack my husband after we ignored him and continued to the hotel. It was very clear he was angry and drunk while on duty. Another security said he was his supervisor and asked us not to report him. We complained to the front desk about the assault and they asked to call us back to discuss it and never did. This was the worse experience ever.  After booking the hotel across the street we enjoyed the service and\n",

      "Review Text: This is the worst hotel experience I’ve had in Lagos and I’ve been in a few on the mainland and island, the glaring presence of scantily clad females all around the hotel ground is unsavoury and very uncomfortable. The bar had flies everywhere. A number of items on the in room dinning menu were unavailable.The Eko gardens is more like a hostel than a hotel with the inescapable whiff of weed. I moved my room from the gardens to Eko suite which cost more, it was slightly better but tired looking with many more ladies loitering in the lobby!  Take my advise, dont stay here, it’s a waste of money!\n",

This trip however was the worst I’ve had at the the Eko. None of the meals were available , pepper soup, no chicken , no meat just fish. Meals took ages to come. When the drinks arrived they were harassing me to pay now and saying signing to the room isn’t possible. After swimming I’m on the seats and they are telling me to leave because they have ‘closed’ meanwhile the Europeans are not being harassed like me.  Breakfast - trying to get me to pay for an extra breakfast when I’ve paid for two rooms for me and my friend. Breakfast , we asked for items and they never brought it.
